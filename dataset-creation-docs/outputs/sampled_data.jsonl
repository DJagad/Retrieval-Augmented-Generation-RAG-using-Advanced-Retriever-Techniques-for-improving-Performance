Any specified subset of the sample space is called an event. Central subjects in probability theory include discrete and continuous random variables, probability distributions, and stochastic processes (which provide mathematical abstractions of non-deterministic or uncertain processes or measured quantities that may either be single occurrences or evolve over time in a random fashion). Although it is not possible to perfectly predict random events, much can be said about their behavior. Two major results in probability theory describing such behaviour are the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.", "response": "Probability\nRandom variable\nDiscrete random variable\nContinuous random variable\nProbability distributions \nLaw of large numbers \nCentral Limit theorem", "category": "information_extraction"}

Cobain's most well-known Stratocaster has a sticker on the body with the text \"VANDALISM: BEAUTIFUL AS A ROCK IN A COP'S FACE.\"\n\nEric Clapton in a Switzerland concert on June 19, 1977.\nRy Cooder (born 1947), a guitarist, singer and composer who is well known for his interest in American folk music, his collaborations with other notable musicians, and his work on many film soundtracks. Cooder's bottleneck slide guitar playing, heard on such works as the soundtrack to the 1984 film Paris, Texas, influenced other guitarists such as Bonnie Raitt and Chris Rea and contributed to the popularity of the Stratocaster as a slide guitar. He uses a '60s Stratocaster for such playing.\nRobert Cray (born 1953), a long-time blues guitarist and singer, Cray plays a '64 Strat and had his own Signature model made in 1990. The signature model, manufactured by the Fender Custom Shop, combines aspects of Cray's '59 Strat and the '64, omits the standard Stratocaster whammy bar, and includes custom pickups.\nDick Dale (1937\u20132019), considered a pioneer of surf rock, was one of the first owners of a Stratocaster; his was given to him personally by Leo Fender in 1955.

Gallagher is well known for his worn 1961 sunburst Stratocaster. He described his battered Stratocaster as \"a part of my psychic makeup\". When asked about its importance, Gallagher said, \"B.B. King has owned over 100 Lucilles, but I only own one Strat, and it hasn't got a name.\" Gallagher's Stratocaster has also been reproduced by the Fender Custom shop, to the exact specs of the original one.\nLowell George (1945\u20131979), primary guitarist and singer of Little Feat. Lowell was proficient on slide guitar employing his trademark tone which he achieved through use of compression and open tunings helping to define his soulful sound as well as giving him the means to play his extended melodic lines. Additionally, he used to swap the bridge pickups of his Stratocasters for Telecaster bridge pickups.\n\nDavid Gilmour in 2006.\nDavid Gilmour (born 1946), as a solo artist and guitar player for Pink Floyd, Gilmour is credited for his unique, blues-based compositional approach and expressive soloing. Author Tony Bacon stated \"his solo on 'Comfortably Numb' remains for many a definitive Strat moment.\" Gilmour's guitar of choice is a custom modified Fender Stratocaster. He is the owner of Strat #0001, which was manufactured in 1954 but was not the first Stratocaster made since Fender does not use sequential serial numbers. Gilmour is considered to be one of the more influential Stratocaster players since the instrument's invention. David's signature black Stratocaster, used frequently in 1970s concerts and on the blockbuster albums The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals and The Wall, is featured in a recent book by his long-time guitar tech Phil Taylor, titled Pink Floyd, The Black Strat\u2014A History of David Gilmour's Black Stratocaster. The \"Black Strat\" was retired in the 1980s in favour of a Candy Apple Red American Vintage Stratocaster fitted with EMG noiseless single-coil pickups as seen on the Delicate Sound of Thunder and Pulse tours. The Black Strat was briefly used on the documentary Classic Albums: Dark Side of the Moon before being put on display at the Hard Rock Cafe in Miami, Florida. It was finally brought out of retirement by David in 2005 and fitted with a '83 Fender Stratocaster neck for the Pink Floyd reunion at the Live 8 concert. David subsequently used it again for his \"On An Island\" album and tour in 2006 and when he played \"Comfortably Numb\" with Roger Waters on his tour of \"The Wall\" on May 12, 2011, in London and also played most of the leads on the final Pink Floyd album The Endless River and his 2015 solo album Rattle That Lock and its tour.\n\nBuddy Guy in 1992.\nBuddy Guy (born 1936), an American blues guitarist and singer, Guy is well known for playing the Stratocaster throughout his long career. He is also known for his wild showmanship; Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan both pointed to Guy as an influence on both their playing and their stage shows. Fender has issued several different variations of a Buddy Guy Signature Stratocaster since the early 1990s; the guitars generally have gold Lace Sensor pickups and modified circuitry.\nAlbert Hammond Jr. (born 1980), guitarist for The Strokes, uses a white Fender Stratocaster as his main guitar for recording and live use. Hammond bought the guitar in 1999 for $400, and used it to record albums such as Is This It and Room on Fire. In 2018, Fender released a signature model of Hammond's guitar, featuring a larger headstock and a modified pickup wiring scheme.\nGeorge Harrison (1943\u20132001), lead guitarist for the Beatles. Harrison and John Lennon obtained matching Sonic Blue Stratocasters in 1965. Unlike Lennon, Harrison employed his Stratocaster more often, using it as his main guitar during the recording sessions for Rubber Soul, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and the White Album. In 1967, Harrison hand-painted his Stratocaster with a psychedelic paint job, using Day-Glo paint on the body and his wife Pattie Boyd's nail polish on the headstock. The guitar's nickname, \"Rocky\", is painted on the headstock. Harrison can be seen playing Rocky in the Magical Mystery Tour film as well as The Concert for Bangla Desh.\n\nJimi Hendrix in 1967.\nJimi Hendrix (1942\u20131970), known for developing blues in a modern context, Hendrix's main stage guitar through most of his short career was a Fender Stratocaster. Although Hendrix played left-handed, he played a conventional right-handed Stratocaster flipped upside down, because he preferred to have the control knobs in the top position. Hendrix was responsible for a large increase in the Stratocaster's popularity during his career. In reference to his famed on-stage Stratocaster burning on the Monterey Pop Festival, Hendrix is quoted as saying, \"The time I burned my guitar it was like a sacrifice. You sacrifice the things you love. I love my guitar.\" In 1990, the white Stratocaster used by Hendrix at the 1969 Woodstock Festival sold in a Sotheby's auction for $270,000, a record price at the time. In 1997 Fender produced a limited edition Hendrix tribute model Stratocaster.\nBuddy Holly (1936\u20131959), identified as \"the first Strat hero.\" A statue of Holly in his home town of Lubbock, Texas, portrays him playing his Stratocaster, and the guitar is also engraved on his tombstone. Although the initial release of the Stratocaster came in 1954, the guitar did not begin to achieve popularity until Holly appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1957 playing a maple-neck Strat. Holly was also pictured on the cover of The Crickets' 1957 album The \"Chirping\" Crickets with a sunburst Stratocaster, inspiring The Shadows' Hank Marvin to adopt the guitar.\nErnie Isley (born 1952), member of the American musical ensemble The Isley Brothers has developed three custom Zeal Stratocasters from Fender Custom Shop, using his personal design.\nEric Johnson (born 1954), a Grammy Award-winning guitarist from Austin, Texas, Johnson has played Stratocasters regularly during his career and has played many different types of music.

Knopfler is known for his very particular and unique fingerstyle playing. The song \"Sultans of Swing\", from Dire Straits' debut album in 1978, was a huge hit that showed the characteristic tone and technique displayed on Knopfler's red Stratocaster. He used the Fender Stratocaster throughout his entire career, as a member of Dire Straits and his solo career. Fender now produces his Signature Stratocaster.\nGreg Koch (born 1966), known for his incendiary guitar work. Koch was a Fender clinician and ambassador. He played the Stratocaster for many years and even recorded an album called Strat's Got Your Tongue.

Kulick stated on his personal website that he used a Fender Power Stratocaster, a model with a humbucking pickup in place of the single-coil bridge pickup, to add a harmony solo line to his song, \"What Love's All About.\" Kulick used a 1989 yellow Fender Strat Plus, during the recording of the 1992 Kiss Revenge album, including for the hit single, \"God Gave Rock 'n Roll to You II.\" Revenge reached the Top 20 in several countries.\nMichael Landau (born 1958), friend of Steve Lukather and prolific session guitarist of the 1980s, has used many Stratocasters in his career and is working with Fender as of 2016 to create a Michael Landau Signature Stratocaster.\nJohn Lennon (1940\u20131980), the Beatles' rhythm guitarist, acquired matching Stratocasters with bandmate George Harrison during the 1965 sessions for Help!. However, Lennon rarely used his Stratocaster, which was notably played on \"Nowhere Man\" and during the Sgt. Pepper sessions. A different Strat was used on the Imagine album. John Lennon acquired a candy apple red \"Strat\" with 22 carat gold electroplated brass hardware around 1980. A photo of him playing this guitar in bed one morning in late 1980, shortly before his death, was used an inner sleeve of the album The John Lennon Collection.\nAlex Lifeson (born 1953), the guitarist for Rush since 1968, first recorded with a black Stratocaster on the Rush 1977 album A Farewell to Kings. In 1979, he modified the '77 Strat with a '57 classic humbucker, a Floyd Rose tremolo unit (first ever made), a Gibson toggle switch on the lower bout, and rewired with master volume/tone. He used that same guitar for the leads and direct recording for 1979's \"Permanent Waves.\" In late 1980, Alex Lifeson acquired two more Strats in red and white, modifying them exactly the same as the former.\nYngwie Malmsteen (born 1963), known for his work in the neo-classical metal genre.

He is known for playing Stratocasters with scalloped fretboards.\nHank Marvin (born 1941), the lead guitarist of The Shadows, Marvin is reputed to be the owner of the first Fender Stratocaster in the UK (given to him by Cliff Richard). The guitar was finished in a shade of Fiesta Red, sometimes referred to as 'Salmon Pink'. This guitar, with its tremolo arm, contributed to the Shadows' distinctive sound. Guitarists such as David Gilmour and Mark Knopfler credit Marvin and The Shadows, who had \"the first Strat that came to England\", with influencing their own decisions to buy Stratocasters.\nJohn Mayer (born 1977), a Grammy Award-winning singer/songwriter, has played Stratocasters throughout his career and has had a Fender Artist Series Stratocaster made in both standard and limited edition form.

Turner was an early adopter of the Stratocaster, buying one on its release in 1954. Unaware that the guitar's tremolo arm could be used to subtle effect, Turner used it to play screaming, swooping and diving solos. Turner explained his technique by saying: \"I thought it was to make the guitar scream\u2014people got so excited when I used that thing.\" Turner was also known to play Telecasters and Jaguars. In 2004 Fender Custom Shop produced an Ike Turner Signature Stratocaster, limited to 100.\nRitchie Valens (1941\u20131959), a pioneer of rock and roll mostly famous for his Latin Rock song \"La Bamba\", played with a sunburst Strat.\nEddie Van Halen (1955\u20132020), guitarist of hard rock band Van Halen, is notable for his \"Frankenstrat\", a crudely modified Stratocaster copy with the single-coil bridge pickup replaced with a PAF humbucker.

{"instruction": "From the following passage, which taxes/acts led to the American Revolution?", "context": "1764\u20131766: Taxes imposed and withdrawn\nMain articles: Sugar Act, Currency Act, Quartering Acts, Stamp Act 1765, and Declaratory Act\nFurther information: No taxation without representation and Virtual representation\n\nNotice of the Stamp Act 1765 in a colonial newspaper\nIn 1764 Parliament passed the Sugar Act, decreasing the existing customs duties on sugar and molasses but providing stricter measures of enforcement and collection. That same year, Prime Minister George Grenville proposed direct taxes on the colonies to raise revenue, but he delayed action to see whether the colonies would propose some way to raise the revenue themselves.\n\nGrenville had asserted in 1762 that the whole revenue of the custom houses in America amounted to one or two thousand pounds sterling a year, and that the English exchequer was paying between seven and eight thousand pounds a year to collect. Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth of Nations that Parliament \"has never hitherto demanded of [the American colonies] anything which even approached to a just proportion to what was paid by their fellow subjects at home.\" Benjamin Franklin would later testify in Parliament in 1766 to the contrary, reporting that Americans already contributed heavily to the defense of the Empire. He argued that local colonial governments had raised, outfitted, and paid 25,000 soldiers to fight France in just the French and Indian War alone\u2014as many as Britain itself sent\u2014and spent many millions from American treasuries doing so.\n\nParliament finally passed the Stamp Act in March 1765, which imposed direct taxes on the colonies for the first time. All official documents, newspapers, almanacs, and pamphlets were required to have the stamps\u2014even decks of playing cards. The colonists did not object that the taxes were high; they were actually low. They objected to their lack of representation in the Parliament, which gave them no voice concerning legislation that affected them. The British were, however, reacting to an entirely different issue: at the conclusion of the recent war the Crown had to deal with approximately 1,500 politically well-connected British Army officers. The decision was made to keep them on active duty with full pay, but they\u2014and their commands\u2014also had to be stationed somewhere. Stationing a standing army in Great Britain during peacetime was politically unacceptable, so they determined to station them in America and have the Americans pay them through the new tax. The soldiers had no military mission however; they were not there to defend the colonies because there was no current threat to the colonies.\n\nThe Sons of Liberty formed shortly after the Act in 1765, and they used public demonstrations, boycotts, and threats of violence to ensure that the British tax laws were unenforceable. In Boston, the Sons of Liberty burned the records of the vice admiralty court and looted the home of chief justice Thomas Hutchinson. Several legislatures called for united action, and nine colonies sent delegates to the Stamp Act Congress in New York City in October. Moderates led by John Dickinson drew up a Declaration of Rights and Grievances stating that taxes passed without representation violated their rights as Englishmen, and colonists emphasized their determination by boycotting imports of British merchandise.\n\nThe Parliament at Westminster saw itself as the supreme lawmaking authority throughout the Empire and thus entitled to levy any tax without colonial approval or even consultation. They argued that the colonies were legally British corporations subordinate to the British Parliament, and they pointed to numerous instances where Parliament had made laws in the past that were binding on the colonies. Parliament insisted that the colonists effectively enjoyed a \"virtual representation\", as most British people did, since only a small minority of the British population elected representatives to Parliament. However, Americans such as James Otis maintained that there was no one in Parliament responsible specifically for any colonial constituency, so they were not \"virtually represented\" by anyone in Parliament at all.\n\nThe Rockingham government came to power in July 1765, and Parliament debated whether to repeal the stamp tax or to send an army to enforce it. Benjamin Franklin made the case for repeal, explaining that the colonies had spent heavily in manpower, money, and blood defending the empire in a series of wars against the French and indigenous people, and that further taxes to pay for those wars were unjust and might bring about a rebellion. Parliament agreed and repealed the tax on February 21, 1766, but they insisted in the Declaratory Act of March 1766 that they retained full power to make laws for the colonies \"in all cases whatsoever\". The repeal nonetheless caused widespread celebrations in the colonies.\n\n1767\u20131773: Townshend Acts and the Tea Act\nMain articles: Townshend Acts and Tea Act\nFurther information: Crisis of 1772, Massachusetts Circular Letter, Boston Massacre, and Boston Tea Party\n\nLetter III of John Dickinson's Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, published in the Pennsylvania Chronicle, December 1767\nIn 1767, the Parliament passed the Townshend Acts which placed duties on a number of staple goods, including paper, glass, and tea, and established a Board of Customs in Boston to more rigorously execute trade regulations. The new taxes were enacted on the belief that Americans only objected to internal taxes and not to external taxes such as custom duties. However, in his widely read pamphlet, Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, John Dickinson argued against the constitutionality of the acts because their purpose was to raise revenue and not to regulate trade. Colonists responded to the taxes by organizing new boycotts of British goods. These boycotts were less effective, however, as the goods taxed by the Townshend Acts were widely used.\n\nIn February 1768, the Assembly of Massachusetts Bay issued a circular letter to the other colonies urging them to coordinate resistance. The governor dissolved the assembly when it refused to rescind the letter. Meanwhile, a riot broke out in Boston in June 1768 over the seizure of the sloop Liberty, owned by John Hancock, for alleged smuggling. Customs officials were forced to flee, prompting the British to deploy troops to Boston. A Boston town meeting declared that no obedience was due to parliamentary laws and called for the convening of a convention. A convention assembled but only issued a mild protest before dissolving itself. In January 1769, Parliament responded to the unrest by reactivating the Treason Act 1543 which called for subjects outside the realm to face trials for treason in England. The governor of Massachusetts was instructed to collect evidence of said treason, and the threat caused widespread outrage, though it was not carried out.\n\nOn March 5, 1770, a large crowd gathered around a group of British soldiers on a Boston street. The crowd grew threatening, throwing snowballs, rocks, and debris at them. One soldier was clubbed and fell. There was no order to fire, but the soldiers panicked and fired into the crowd. They hit 11 people; three civilians died of wounds at the scene of the shooting, and two died shortly after the incident. The event quickly came to be called the Boston Massacre. The soldiers were tried and acquitted (defended by John Adams), but the widespread descriptions soon began to turn colonial sentiment against the British. This accelerated the downward spiral in the relationship between Britain and the Province of Massachusetts.\n\nA new ministry under Lord North came to power in 1770, and Parliament withdrew all taxes except the tax on tea, giving up its efforts to raise revenue while maintaining the right to tax. This temporarily resolved the crisis, and the boycott of British goods largely ceased, with only the more radical patriots such as Samuel Adams continuing to agitate.[citation needed]\n\n\nOn June 9, 1772, the Sons of Liberty burned HMS Gaspee, a British customs schooner in Narragansett Bay.\nIn June 1772, American patriots, including John Brown, burned a British warship that had been vigorously enforcing unpopular trade regulations, in what became known as the Gaspee Affair. The affair was investigated for possible treason, but no action was taken.\n\nIn 1772, it became known that the Crown intended to pay fixed salaries to the governors and judges in Massachusetts, which had been paid by local authorities. This would reduce the influence of colonial representatives over their government. Samuel Adams in Boston set about creating new Committees of Correspondence, which linked Patriots in all 13 colonies and eventually provided the framework for a rebel government. Virginia, the largest colony, set up its Committee of Correspondence in early 1773, on which Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson served.\n\nA total of about 7,000 to 8,000 Patriots served on Committees of Correspondence at the colonial and local levels, comprising most of the leadership in their communities. Loyalists were excluded. The committees became the leaders of the American resistance to British actions, and later largely determined the war effort at the state and local level. When the First Continental Congress decided to boycott British products, the colonial and local Committees took charge, examining merchant records and publishing the names of merchants who attempted to defy the boycott by importing British goods.\n\nIn 1773, private letters were published in which Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson claimed that the colonists could not enjoy all English liberties, and in which Lieutenant Governor Andrew Oliver called for the direct payment of colonial officials. The letters' contents were used as evidence of a systematic plot against American rights, and discredited Hutchinson in the eyes of the people; the colonial Assembly petitioned for his recall. Benjamin Franklin, postmaster general for the colonies, acknowledged that he leaked the letters, which led to him being berated by British officials and removed from his position.\n\n\nThe December 16, 1773 Boston Tea Party, led by Samuel Adams and Sons of Liberty, has become a mainstay of American patriotic lore.\nMeanwhile, Parliament passed the Tea Act lowering the price of taxed tea exported to the colonies, to help the British East India Company undersell smuggled untaxed Dutch tea. Special consignees were appointed to sell the tea to bypass colonial merchants. The act was opposed by those who resisted the taxes and also by smugglers who stood to lose business.[citation needed] In most instances, the consignees were forced by the Americans to resign and the tea was turned back, but Massachusetts governor Hutchinson refused to allow Boston merchants to give in to pressure. A town meeting in Boston determined that the tea would not be landed, and ignored a demand from the governor to disperse. On December 16, 1773, a group of men, led by Samuel Adams and dressed to evoke the appearance of indigenous people, boarded the ships of the East India Company and dumped \u00a310,000 worth of tea from their holds (approximately \u00a3636,000 in 2008) into Boston Harbor. Decades later, this event became known as the Boston Tea Party and remains a significant part of American patriotic lore.\n\n1774\u20131775: Intolerable Acts\nMain article: Intolerable Acts\nFurther information: Quebec Act and Continental Association\n\nA 1774 etching from The London Magazine depicts Prime Minister Lord North, author of the Boston Port Act, forcing the Intolerable Acts down the throat of America, whose arms are restrained by Lord Chief Justice Mansfield, and a tattered \"Boston Petition\" lays trampled on the ground beside her. Lord Sandwich pins down her feet and peers up her robes; behind them, Mother Britannia weeps while France and Spain look on.\nThe British government responded by passing several measures that came to be known as the Intolerable Acts, further darkening colonial opinion towards England. They consisted of four laws enacted by the British parliament. The first was the Massachusetts Government Act which altered the Massachusetts charter and restricted town meetings. The second act was the Administration of Justice Act which ordered that all British soldiers to be tried were to be arraigned in Britain, not in the colonies. The third Act was the Boston Port Act, which closed the port of Boston until the British had been compensated for the tea lost in the Boston Tea Party. The fourth Act was the Quartering Act of 1774, which allowed royal governors to house British troops in the homes of citizens without requiring permission of the owner.\n\nIn response, Massachusetts patriots issued the Suffolk Resolves and formed an alternative shadow government known as the Provincial Congress which began training militia outside British-occupied Boston. In September 1774, the First Continental Congress convened, consisting of representatives from each colony, to serve as a vehicle for deliberation and collective action. During secret debates, conservative Joseph Galloway proposed the creation of a colonial Parliament that would be able to approve or disapprove acts of the British Parliament, but his idea was tabled in a vote of 6 to 5 and was subsequently removed from the record.[citation needed] Congress called for a boycott beginning on December 1, 1774, of all British goods; it was enforced by new local committees authorized by the Congress.", "response": "The following Acts passed by the British Parliament led to the American Revolution:\n1) The Sugar Act in 1764 provided stricter measures of enforcement and collection for sugar taxes.\n2) The Stamp Act in 1765 imposed direct taxes on official documents, newspapers, almanacs, pamphlets, and playing cards.\n3) The Declaratory Act in 1766 declared the British Parliament retained full taxation powers for the American Colonies.\n4) The Townshend Acts in 1767 added duties to goods like paper, glass, and tea.\n5) The Tea Act in 1773 lowered the taxes on tea to benefit the British East India Company.\n6) The so-called Intolerable Acts in 1774 consisted of 4 laws that increased Britain's sovereignty over the American Colonies.  These laws include the rights of Britain to restrict town meetings, try British soldiers for crimes committed in the American colonies, close the port of Boston, and require housing of British troops in the homes of citizens.", "category": "information_extraction"}

{"instruction": "According to the given paragraph, how do convolutional neural networks avoid overfitting in machine learning?", "context": "In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is a class of artificial neural network most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery. CNNs use a mathematical operation called convolution in place of general matrix multiplication in at least one of their layers. They are specifically designed to process pixel data and are used in image recognition and processing. They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, image segmentation, medical image analysis, natural language processing, brain\u2013computer interfaces, and financial time series.\n\nCNNs are also known as Shift Invariant or Space Invariant Artificial Neural Networks (SIANN), based on the shared-weight architecture of the convolution kernels or filters that slide along input features and provide translation-equivariant responses known as feature maps. Counter-intuitively, most convolutional neural networks are not invariant to translation, due to the downsampling operation they apply to the input.\n\nCNNs are regularized versions of multilayer perceptrons. Multilayer perceptrons are usually fully connected networks, that is, each neuron in one layer is connected to all neurons in the next layer. The \"full connectivity\" of these networks make them prone to overfitting data. Typical ways of regularization, or preventing overfitting, include: penalizing parameters during training (such as weight decay) or trimming connectivity (skipped connections, dropout, etc.) Developing robust datasets also increases the probability that CNNs will learn the generalized principles that characterize a given dataset rather than the biases of a poorly-populated set.", "response": "A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has a fully connected layer in which each neuron is connected to every neuron in the next layer, this structure helps to avoid overfitting", "category": "summarization"}

Owaneco presided over the village known as Montonesuck. Uncas was bilingual, learning Mohegan and some English, and possibly some Dutch.\n\nIn 1626, Owaneco arranged for Uncas to marry the daughter of the principal Pequot sachem Tatobem to secure an alliance with them.

Tatobem was captured and killed by the Dutch in 1633; Sassacus became his successor, but Uncas felt that he deserved to be sachem.\n\nOwaneco's alliance with Tatobem was based upon a balance of power between the Mohegans and Pequots. After the death of Owaneco, the balance changed in favour of the Pequots. Uncas was unwilling to challenge the power of Tatobem; however, Uncas did begin contesting Pequot authority over the Mohegans. In 1634 with Narragansett support, Uncas rebelled against Sassacus and Pequot authority. Uncas was defeated and became an exile among the Narragansetts. He soon returned from exile after ritually humiliating himself before Sassacus.

It lies in the Karakoram range, partially in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan-administered Kashmir and partially in a China-administered territory Trans-Karakoram Tract included in the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County of Xinjiang.\n\nK2 also became popularly known as the Savage Mountain after George Bell\u2014a climber on the 1953 American expedition\u2014told reporters, \"It's a savage mountain that tries to kill you.\" Of the five highest mountains in the world, K2 is the deadliest; approximately one person dies on the mountain for every four who reach the summit. Also occasionally known as Mount Godwin-Austen, other nicknames for K2 are The King of Mountains and The Mountaineers' Mountain, as well as The Mountain of Mountains after prominent Italian climber Reinhold Messner titled his book about K2 the same.\n\nThe summit was reached for the first time by the Italian climbers Lino Lacedelli and Achille Compagnoni, on the 1954 Italian expedition led by Ardito Desio. In January 2021, K2 became the final eight-thousander to be summited in the winter; the mountaineering feat was accomplished by a team of Nepalese climbers, led by Nirmal Purja and Mingma Gyalje Sherpa.\n\nK2 is the only 8,000+ metres (26,000+ ft) peak that has never been climbed from its eastern face. Ascents have almost always been made in July and August, which are typically the warmest times of the year; K2's more northern location makes it more susceptible to inclement and colder weather. The peak has now been climbed by almost all of its ridges. Although the summit of Everest is at a higher altitude, K2 is a more difficult and dangerous climb, due in part to its more inclement weather. As of February 2021, only 377 people have completed the ascent to its summit. There have been 91 deaths during attempted climbs.\n\nThere are a number of routes on K2, of somewhat different character, but they all share some key difficulties, the first being the extremely high altitude and resulting lack of oxygen: there is only one-third as much oxygen available to a climber on the summit of K2 as there is at sea level. The second is the propensity of the mountain to experience extreme storms of several days duration, which have resulted in many of the deaths on the peak. The third is the steep, exposed, and committing nature of all routes on the mountain, which makes retreat more difficult, especially during a storm. Despite many attempts the first successful winter ascents occurred only in 2021. All major climbing routes lie on the Pakistani side.[citation needed] The base camp is also located on the Pakistani side.", "response": "Although not as well-known as Mount Everest, K2 is the second highest mountain on earth and is arguably the most dangerous to climb.

Once the brisket is properly seasoned, place the brisket on your pellet grill.  It is common in Texas to place the brisket fat side up.  In other areas of the country, it is more common to place the brisket fat side down.  Allow your brisket to smoke until it reaches an internal temperature of 175 degrees.  Depending on the size of the brisket this could take in excess of 12 hours.  Once the brisket reaches an internal temperature of 175 degrees, wrap the brisket with butcher paper to build better bark.  Alternatively you can wrap the brisket in foil which will finish the cooking faster but build less bark.  Place the wrapped brisket back in your pellet smoker and increase the temperature to 275 degrees Fahrenheit.  Once the brisket reaches a temperature of 205 degrees Fahrenheit remove the brisket from our pellet smoker and allow it to rest in a cooler or oven until the brisket reaches an internal temperature of 140 degrees.  Depending on the size of the brisket this could take between 2 and 3 hours.  Slice your brisket and serve.", "category": "general_qa"}

During the circling of the bonfire, upperclassmen encourage the freshmen to \"touch the fire\", an action legally considered trespassing and prohibited by police officials present. At halftime of the Homecoming football game on the Saturday of the weekend, some upperclassmen encourage freshman to \"rush the field\", although no upperclassman has seen a significant rush since several injuries sustained during the 1986 rush prompted the school to ban the practice. Among the two or three students who sometimes run across the field, those who are arrested are charged with trespassing (the independent newspaper The Dartmouth Review claimed to set up a fund to automatically pay any fines associated with freshman who rush the field.) However, in 2012 this was proven false when two students rushed the field and were arrested for disorderly conduct. The Dartmouth Review ignored their emails until finally replying and denying that this fund had ever existed. These students then had to pay $300 fines out of pocket.

{"instruction": "How does a transistor amplify a signal?", "context": "", "response": "A transistor is a constructed from materials that behave as semiconductors--which is to say that these materials conduct electrical current but only when certain conditions are met. By combining these materials into a device called a transistor we are able to create an electronic component that will only conduct electricity when a small electric current is applied to the so-called Base pin of the transistor.\n\nOne obvious use of such behavior is to use the transistor as a switch--by applying or removing current to the base pin we are able to control whether the transistor conducts electricity via its collector and emitter pins. When no current is present at the Base pin the transistor will block electrical transmission through its emitter and collector pins.\n\nGenerally speaking, the electrical current required to control the transistor at the base pin is very small. Much larger currents can be transferred through the device through the collector and emitter pins. Thus, in effect, a transistor uses a very small input current to control the flow of a much larger current.\n\nAn audio signal, for example, is transmitted as a very low power electrical current--in it's original form it is too small to be able to drive a loudspeaker to make sounds that are audible to the human ear. To amplify this signal so that is usable for audio playback we can apply the audio signal to a transistor's base pin--this will allow a much larger current to flow between the emitter and collector pins and through the transistor. Since the flow of this large current will mirror the much smaller current of the audio signal we will have effectively created a much stronger version of the original input signal.", "category": "general_qa"}

Avoid clutter and too much distraction, but also feel free to use that part of the office to express yourself professionally. An interesting painting or a few professional accolades can be a good conversation starters.\n\n* Bright windows can be great for creativity but having these directly behind you when on video calls can give you a whitewashed look that's not ideal. Ideally, a window would be in front of you to not only cast your face in a good light, but also to give you a nice view as you work. If you can't position a window on front of your desk, you could always invest in good artificial lighting (e.g., a ring light) to help with video calls. \n\n* Avoid having positioning your desk so your back is directly in front of the office entrance. If you have line of site to all entrances / exits you'll likely feel more in control while working, which can make you more productive. \n\n* Position your desk so you have easy access to everything you'd need for work.

They are capable of natural language processing, machine translation, and natural language generation and can be used as foundation models for other tasks. Data sets include BookCorpus, Wikipedia, and others (see List of text corpora).\nCode: In addition to natural language text, large language models can be trained on programming language text, allowing them to generate source code for new computer programs. Examples include OpenAI Codex.\nImages: Generative AI systems trained on sets of images with text captions include such as Imagen, DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and others (see Artificial intelligence art, Generative art, Synthetic media). They are commonly used for text-to-image generation and neural style transfer. Datasets include LAION-5B and others (See Datasets in computer vision).\nMolecules: Generative AI systems can be trained on sequences of amino acids or molecular representations such as SMILES representing DNA or proteins. These systems, such as AlphaFold, are used for protein structure prediction and drug discovery. Datasets include various biological datasets.\nMusic: Generative AI systems such as MusicLM can be trained on the audio waveforms of recorded music along with text annotations, in order to generate new musical samples based on text descriptions such as \"a calming violin melody backed by a distorted guitar riff\".\nVideo: Generative AI trained on annotated video can generate temporally-coherent video clips. Examples include Gen1 by RunwayML and Make-A-Video by Meta Platforms.\nMultimodal: A generative AI system can be built from multiple generative models, or one model trained on multiple types of data. For example, one version of OpenAI's GPT-4 accepts both text and image inputs.", "response": "text data set examples of Generative artificial intelligence Data sets include BookCorpus, Wikipedia", "category": "summarization"}
{"instruction": "Should we continue to use Daylight savings?", "context": "", "response": "While it is hard for our bodies to adjust to and oftentimes inconvenient, daylight savings time should be maintained in the USA as it saves energy, money, and lives.\n\tDaylight savings, though sometimes disrupting, helps to limit the energy wasted by Americans during the summer months. Source A reveals that, beginning in the USA in 1918, daylight saving time was originally a way to reduce energy usage during World War I. While it was repealed shortly thereafter, daylight savings was again suggested by President Roosevelt during World War II. Though inconvenient, Americans did take notice of the benefits: saving money on energy. The continued testing of daylight savings\u2019 effects on Americans lasted through the 20th century and was written into law in 2005. Despite the skepticism from Americans over the potential drawbacks of daylight saving, the reaped benefits of saved energy and money mutually benefited the American government, economy, and citizens, all of which are still benefitting today.\n\tThe ability to save unnecessary energy now benefit\u2019s the American economy in the long run. In Source B, Longley cites a 1970s study by the U.S. Department of Transportation, which revealed that while daylight savings is in effect, America's electricity consumption is reduced by about one percent. Reducing one percent of America\u2019s energy consumption would save Americans money. Also in Source B is the proposal for a provision to the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which would extend daylight savings an extra month and would allow oil drilling in Alaska, both of which would boost the American economy. The extension of daylight savings would overall save more money than it would spend.\n\tDespite the beneficial economic aspects of daylight saving, many dislike the time change because it affects their body schedules and daily routines. Source E claims that when the clock is moved forward or back, the body\u2019s internal clock cannot adjust so quickly, leading to restlessness, sleep disruption, and shorter sleeping periods. The time change has also been found to link with increased heart attacks, suicides, and accidents. While the body\u2019s internal clock may take a longer time to adjust to daylight savings time, it doesn\u2019t outweigh the economic benefits the USA gains as a whole. Source E cites a study of 55,000 people whose sleep schedules were tracked after the time change, claiming that the subjects tended to sleep on standard time rather than daylight time, not taking into account the potential variables of age, weekend events or activities, or even the body\u2019s natural reaction to wake up at a certain time. The study also reveals no harmful effects of the difference between sleeping on standard versus daylight savings time.\n\tWhile Source E argued that daylight savings time had more dangerous effects on people than remaining on standard time, daylight savings time can actually benefit people\u2019s safety. In Source C, a cited study by the U.S. Department of Transportation found that during daylight saving time, there was a severe reduction in crime by ten to thirteen percent. By changing the clocks and altering the amount of sunlight during the day, people were generally less likely to become involved in any street crime taking place. The Department of Transportation also found that daylight savings time helped to increase traffic safety, as the clocks were altered to match the periods of daylight, causing fewer accidents. Daylight savings overall led to safer daily activities, while still saving money and energy.\n\tDaylight savings has been long disputed over: should we inconvenience ourselves just to save a little energy? Despite many people\u2019s dislike of the changing times, daylight savings is generally beneficial to America, as it saves energy, reduces energy costs and bills for Americans, and creates a safer environment for people to live in. Daylight savings time should be continued as it ultimately benefits the American public as a whole.", "category": "creative_writing"}

{"instruction": "How to play chess", "context": "The rules of chess (also known as the laws of chess) govern the play of the game of chess. Chess is a two-player abstract strategy board game. Each player controls sixteen pieces of six types on a chessboard. Each type of piece moves in a distinct way. The object of the game is to checkmate (threaten with inescapable capture) the opponent's king. A game can end in various ways besides checkmate: a player can resign, and there are several ways a game can end in a draw.\n\nWhile the exact origins of chess are unclear, modern rules first took form during the Middle Ages. The rules continued to be slightly modified until the early 19th century, when they reached essentially their current form. The rules also varied somewhat from region to region. Today, the standard rules are set by FIDE (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des \u00c9checs), the international governing body for chess. Slight modifications are made by some national organizations for their own purposes. There are variations of the rules for fast chess, correspondence chess, online chess, and Chess960.\n\nBesides the basic moves of the pieces, rules also govern the equipment used, time control, conduct and ethics of players, accommodations for physically challenged players, and recording of moves using chess notation.

{"instruction": "Explain the difference between rhotic and non-rhotic dialects of English.", "context": "Rhoticity in English is the pronunciation of the historical rhotic consonant /r/ by English speakers. The presence or absence of rhoticity is one of the most prominent distinctions by which varieties of English can be classified. In rhotic varieties, the historical English /r/ sound is preserved in all pronunciation contexts. In non-rhotic varieties, speakers no longer pronounce /r/ in postvocalic environments\u2014that is, when it is immediately after a vowel and not followed by another vowel. For example, in isolation, a rhotic English speaker pronounces the words hard and butter as /\u02c8h\u0251\u02d0rd/ and /\u02c8b\u028ct\u0259r/, whereas a non-rhotic speaker \"drops\" or \"deletes\" the /r/ sound, pronouncing them as /\u02c8h\u0251\u02d0d/ and /\u02c8b\u028ct\u0259/. When an r is at the end of a word but the next word begins with a vowel, as in the phrase \"better apples\", most non-rhotic speakers will pronounce the /r/ in that position (the linking R), since it is followed by a vowel in this case.\n\nThe rhotic varieties of English include the dialects of South West England, Scotland, Ireland, and most of the United States and Canada. The non-rhotic varieties include most of the dialects of modern England, Wales, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. In some varieties, such as those of some parts of the southern and northeastern United States, rhoticity is a sociolinguistic variable: postvocalic r is deleted depending on an array of social factors, such as being more correlated today with lower socioeconomic status, greater age, certain ethnic identities, and less formal speaking contexts.\n\nEvidence from written documents suggests that loss of postvocalic /r/ began sporadically during the mid-15th century, although these /r/-less spellings were uncommon and were restricted to private documents, especially ones written by women in England. In the mid-18th century, postvocalic /r/ was still pronounced in most environments, but by the 1740s to 1770s it was often deleted entirely, especially after low vowels. By the early 19th century, the southern British standard was fully transformed into a non-rhotic variety, though some variation persisted as late as the 1870s.\n\nIn the 18th century (and possibly 17th century), the loss of postvocalic /r/ in British English influenced southern and eastern American port cities with close connections to Britain, causing their upper-class pronunciation to become non-rhotic while the rest of the United States remained rhotic. Non-rhotic pronunciation continued to influence American prestige speech until the 1860s, when the American Civil War began to shift America's centers of wealth and political power to rhotic areas with fewer cultural connections to the old colonial and British elites. In the United States, non-rhotic speech continued to hold some level of prestige up until the mid-20th century, but rhotic speech in particular became prestigious nationwide rapidly after the Second World War, reflected in the national standard of radio and television since the mid-20th century embracing historical /r/.", "response": "In rhotic English dialects, the historical English /r/ sound is preserved in all pronunciation contexts.

Traditionally, those who run \"runners\" will run 5-7 days a week. Runners will average between 3 miles per run up to 20 miles per run. While running is great exercise and very efficient at burning calories, it can be hard on the body. Specifically the leg joints. The average runner will strike the surface they are running on 1,480 times per mile. So if you are running 10 miles, thats just under 15,000 foot strikes. This repetitive striking can deteriorate the body joints over time. Therefore, the type of surface a runner runs on, can have a huge impact on the body. Some surfaces are harder than others, the harder the surface, the harder on the body, legs and joints. Concrete is harder than asphalt, asphalt is harder than a dirt trail and a dirt trail is harder than a high school track surface. Example, concrete can be 30% harder surface than asphalt. Running is a great exercise and millions of people enjoy running. But if you want to run long, as in for a long time, choose your running surface for the long run.

The Bengali Hindu intelligentsia exerted considerable influence on local and national politics. The partition outraged Bengalis. Widespread agitation ensued in the streets and in the press, and the Congress advocated boycotting British products under the banner of swadeshi, or indigenous industries. A growing movement emerged, focussing on indigenous Indian industries, finance, and education, which saw the founding of National Council of Education, the birth of Indian financial institutions and banks, as well as an interest in Indian culture and achievements in science and literature. Hindus showed unity by tying Rakhi on each other's wrists and observing Arandhan (not cooking any food).

The legend goes back to the fabled battle of Kurukshetra fought between the five Pandava brothers and their cousins, the 100 Kaurava brothers, which is the pivot of the Mahabharata. Many folk legends related to the Garhwal region, Lord Shiva and the creation of the Panch Kedar temples are narrated.\n\nA folk legend about Panch Kedar relates to the Pandavas, the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. The Pandavas defeated and slayed their cousins \u2014 the Kauravas in the epic Kurukshetra war. They wished to atone for the sins of committing fratricide (gotra hatya) and Br\u0101hmanahatya (killing of Brahmins \u2014 the priest class) during the war. Thus, they handed over the reins of their kingdom to their kin and left in search of lord Shiva and to seek his blessings. First, they went to the holy city of Varanasi (Kashi), believed to be Shiva's favourite city and known for its Kashi Vishwanath Temple. But, Shiva wanted to avoid them as he was deeply incensed by the death and dishonesty at the Kurukshetra war and was, therefore, insensitive to Pandavas' prayers. Therefore, he assumed the form of a bull (Nandi) and hid in the Garhwal region.\n\nNot finding Shiva in Varanasi, the Pandavas went to Garhwal Himalayas. Bhima, the second of the five Pandava brothers, then standing astride two mountains started to look for Shiva. He saw a bull grazing near Guptakashi (\u201chidden Kashi\u201d \u2014 the name derived from the hiding act of Shiva). Bhima immediately recognized the bull to be Shiva. Bhima caught hold of the bull by its tail and hind legs. But the bull-formed Shiva disappeared into the ground to later reappear in parts, with the hump raising in Kedarnath, the arms appearing in Tungnath, the face showing up at Rudranath, the nabhi (navel) and stomach surfacing in Madhyamaheshwar and the hair appearing in Kalpeshwar. The Pandavas pleased with this reappearance in five different forms, built temples at the five places for venerating and worshipping Shiva. The Pandavas were thus freed from their sins. It is also believed that the fore portions of Shiva appeared at Doleshwor Mahadeva Temple, Bhaktapur district Nepal.\n\nA variant of the tale credits Bhima of not only catching the bull, but also stopping it from disappearing. Consequently, the bull was torn asunder into five parts and appeared at five locations in the Kedar Khand of Garhwal region of the Himalayas. After building the Panch Kedar Temples, the Pandavas meditated at Kedarnath for salvation, performed yagna (fire sacrifice) and then through the heavenly path called the Mahapanth (also called Swargarohini), attained heaven or salvation.[citation needed]. The Panch Kedar Temples are constructed in the North-Indian Himalayan Temple architecture with the Kedarnath, Tungnath and Madhyamaheshwar temples looking similar.\n\nAfter completing the pilgrimage of Lord Shiva's darshan at the Panch Kedar Temples, it is an unwritten religious rite to visit Lord Vishnu at the Badrinath Temple, as a final affirmatory proof by the devotee that he has sought blessings of Lord Shiva.\n\nResearch and findings\nThe Hindu activist Bharat Jangam had been researching and claiming that Doleshwar Mahadev is the head part of Kedarnath based on the surprising links between Kedarnath and Doleshwor. The Sculptures of Shive found in both shrines are 4,000 years old. Even a stone scripture found in Doleshwor was written in Sanskrit and Old Nepalese. The priests in both shrines are selected from India's southern states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Both priests affix the word \u2018ling\u2019 after their names to convey their proximity to the god as his worshipper and both temples have a cluster of five Shiva shrines. The main deity of both priests is Birbhadra, a companion of Shiva, according to Hindu scriptures. \n\nRecognition\nOn August 22, 2009 the head priest of Kedarnath peeth Shree 1008 Jagat Guru Bheemashankarling Shivacharya unveiled the plaque claiming that Doleswore Mahadev, located in Jangam math Bhaktapur, is the head part of Shri Kedarnath. He performed Rudra Abhishek, a special worshipping at the Doleshwor temple situated in Sipadol village of Bhaktapur district.

Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.\nAuroras are the result of disturbances in the\u00a0magnetosphere\u00a0caused by the\u00a0solar wind. Major disturbances result from enhancements in the speed of the solar wind from\u00a0coronal holes\u00a0and\u00a0coronal mass ejections. These disturbances alter the trajectories of\u00a0charged particles\u00a0in the magnetospheric plasma. These particles, mainly\u00a0electrons\u00a0and\u00a0protons,\u00a0precipitate\u00a0into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere). The resulting\u00a0ionization\u00a0and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying colour and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles.\nIn northern\u00a0latitudes, the effect is known as the aurora borealis or the northern lights. The former term was coined by\u00a0Galileo\u00a0in 1619, from the\u00a0Roman\u00a0goddess of the dawn\u00a0and the\u00a0Greek\u00a0name for the north wind.\u00a0The southern counterpart, the aurora australis or the southern lights, has features almost identical to the aurora borealis and changes simultaneously with changes in the northern auroral zone.\u00a0The aurora australis is visible from high southern latitudes in\u00a0Antarctica,\u00a0Chile,\u00a0Argentina,\u00a0South Africa,\u00a0New Zealand\u00a0and\u00a0Australia.

{"instruction": "Who is credited with the recognition of electromagnetism?", "context": "Long before any knowledge of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from electric fish. Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.\nThales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nElectricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\",, elektron, the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.\nFurther work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges\nIn 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1819\u20131820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862.\u200a\nWhile the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, \u00c1nyos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.\nSolid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology. The first working transistor, a germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948.", "response": "The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1819\u20131820.", "category": "information_extraction"}

{"instruction": "What is Singlish?", "context": "", "response": "Singlish (a portmanteau of Singapore and English) (officially similar and related to Singaporean English) is an English-based creole language spoken in Singapore. Singlish arose out of a situation of prolonged language contact between speakers of many different languages in Singapore, including Hokkien, Malay, Teochew, Cantonese and Tamil.\n\nSinglish originated with the arrival of the British and the establishment of English-medium education in Singapore. Elements of English quickly filtered out of schools and onto the streets, resulting in the development of a pidgin language spoken by non-native speakers as a lingua franca used for communication between speakers of the many different languages used in Singapore. Singlish evolved mainly among the working classes who learned elements of English without formal schooling, mixing in elements of their native languages. After some time, this new pidgin language, now combined with substantial influences from Indian English, Peranakan, southern varieties of Chinese, Malay, and Tamil, became the primary language of the streets. As Singlish grew in popularity, children began to acquire Singlish as their native language, a process known as creolization. Through this process of creolization, Singlish became a fully-formed, stabilized and independent creole language, acquiring a more robust vocabulary and more complex grammar, with fixed phonology, syntax, morphology, and syntactic embedding.\n\nSinglish shares many linguistic similarities with Manglish or Bazaar Malay of Malaysia, although a few distinctions can be made, particularly in vocabulary. Manglish generally receives more Malay influence and Singlish more Chinese (Mandarin, Hokkien, etc.) influence. Initially, Singlish and Manglish were essentially the same dialect evolving from the British Malaya economy, born in the trading ports of Singapore, Malacca and Penang when Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia were for many purposes a de facto (from 1963 to 1965, de jure) single entity. Ever since the two countries separated, a divergence has been observed.\n\nLike all languages, Singlish and other creole languages show consistent internal logic and grammatical complexity. Due to its origins, Singlish shares many similarities with other English-based creole languages. As with many other creole languages, it is sometimes incorrectly perceived to be a \"broken\" form of the lexifier language - in this case, English. The uniqueness of Singlish has been studied by linguistics experts beyond Singapore.", "category": "open_qa"}

{"instruction": "Which component of a PV solar system implements MPPT?", "context": "Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) or sometimes just power point tracking (PPT), is a technique used with variable power sources to maximize energy extraction as conditions vary. The technique is most commonly used with photovoltaic (PV) solar systems, but can also be used with wind turbines, optical power transmission and thermophotovoltaics.\n\nPV solar systems have varying relationships to inverter systems, external grids, battery banks, and other electrical loads. The central problem addressed by MPPT is that the efficiency of power transfer from the solar cell depends on the amount of available sunlight, shading, solar panel temperature and the load's electrical characteristics. As these conditions vary, the load characteristic (impedance) that gives the highest power transfer changes. The system is optimized when the load characteristic changes to keep power transfer at highest efficiency. This optimal load characteristic is called the maximum power point (MPP). MPPT is the process of adjusting the load characteristic as the conditions change. Circuits can be designed to present optimal loads to the photovoltaic cells and then convert the voltage, current, or frequency to suit other devices or systems.\n\nSolar cells' non-linear relationship between temperature and total resistance can be analyzed based on the Current-voltage (I-V) curve and the power-voltage (P-V) curves. MPPT samples cell output and applies the proper resistance (load) to obtain maximum power. MPPT devices are typically integrated into an electric power converter system that provides voltage or current conversion, filtering, and regulation for driving various loads, including power grids, batteries, or motors. Solar inverters convert DC power to AC power and may incorporate MPPT.\n\nThe power at the MPP (Pmpp) is the product of the MPP voltage (Vmpp) and MPP current (Impp).\n\nIn general, the P-V curve of a partially shaded solar array can have multiple peaks, and some algorithms can get stuck in a local maximum rather than the global maximum of the curve.", "response": "An MPPT device is usually integrated into the electric power converter system.

Due to its complex and subjective nature, this measure is often revised before being considered a reliable indicator.[citation needed] GDP (nominal) per capita does not, however, reflect differences in the cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries; therefore, using a basis of GDP per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) may be more useful when comparing living standards between nations, while nominal GDP is more useful comparing national economies on the international market.

Examples include \u2013 being: well fed, sheltered, and healthy; doing: work, education, voting, participating in community life. The freedom of choice is central \u2013 someone choosing to be hungry (e.g. when fasting for religious reasons) is quite different from someone who is hungry because they cannot afford to buy food, or because the country is in a famine.\n\nThe index does not take into account several factors, such as the net wealth per capita or the relative quality of goods in a country. This situation tends to lower the ranking of some of the most developed countries, such as the G7 members and others.", "response": "Human Development Index (HDI) is a statistic composite index of the following metrics for a country:\n1. life expectancy of the population\n2. education (years of schooling completed and expected years of schooling upon entering the education system)\n3. per capita income indicators", "category": "summarization"}

They are sometimes referred to collectively as continuous development or continuous software development.\n\nComparison\nContinuous integration\nFrequent merging of several small changes into a main branch.\nContinuous delivery\nWhen teams produce software in short cycles with high speed and frequency so that reliable software can be released at any time, and with a simple and repeatable deployment process when deciding to deploy.\nContinuous deployment\nWhen new software functionality is rolled out completely automatically.\nMotivation\nCI/CD bridges the gaps between development and operation activities and teams by enforcing automation in building, testing and deployment of applications. CI/CD services compile the incremental code changes made by developers, then link and package them into software deliverables. Automated tests verify the software functionality, and automated deployment services deliver them to end users. The aim is to increase early defect discovery, increase productivity, and provide faster release cycles. The process contrasts with traditional methods where a collection of software updates were integrated into one large batch before deploying the newer version. Modern-day DevOps practices involve:\n\ncontinuous development,\ncontinuous testing,\ncontinuous integration,\ncontinuous deployment, and\ncontinuous monitoring\nof software applications throughout its development life cycle. The CI/CD practice, or CI/CD pipeline, forms the backbone of modern day DevOps operations.\n\nSee also\nContinuous integration (CI)\nContinuous delivery (CD)\nContinuous deployment (CD)\nReferences\n Sacolick, Isaac (2020-01-17). \"What is CI/CD?

{"instruction": "Given a reference text about the incudomalleolar joint, tell me its main function.", "context": "The incudomalleolar joint (more correctly called incudomallear joint) or articulatio incudomallearis is a small synovial joint between the malleus (hammer) and the incus (anvil). The joint's function is to transfer vibrations between the ossicles in the middle ear, which is perceived as sound. Contrary to other synovial joints the movement is very limited. All of the ossicles move more or less as a unit, at least at low frequencies.\n\nWhen the eardrum is moved inward due to sound vibrations, transferred through the outer ear, it transmits to the handle or manubrium of the malleus which is connected to the ear drum. The head of the malleus (caput mallei) moves with it and transfers energy/movement to the corpus of the incus (corpus incudis), which is located directly behind. The sound vibrations are then transferred to the stapes (stirrup) through the incudostapedial joint.", "response": "The function of the incudomalleolar joint is to transfer vibrations between the ossicles in the middle ear.", "category": "closed_qa"}

{"instruction": "How did early civilizations use dates and dried fruits?", "context": "Traditional dried fruit such as raisins, figs, dates, apricots and apples have been a staple of Mediterranean diets for millennia. This is due partly to their early cultivation in the Middle Eastern region known as the Fertile Crescent, made up by parts of modern Iran, Iraq, southwest Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, and northern Egypt. Drying or dehydration also happened to be the earliest form of food preservation: grapes, dates, and figs that fell from the tree or vine would dry in the hot sun. Early hunter-gatherers observed that these fallen fruit took on an edible form, and valued them for their stability as well as their concentrated sweetness. \nThe earliest recorded mention of dried fruits can be found in Mesopotamian tablets dating to about 1500 BC, which contain what are probably the oldest known written recipes. These clay slabs, written in Akkadian, the daily language of Babylonia, were inscribed in cuneiform and tell of diets based on grains (barley, millet, wheat), vegetables and fruits such as dates, figs, apples, pomegranates, and grapes. These early civilizations used dates, date juice evaporated into syrup and raisins as sweeteners. They included dried fruits in their breads for which they had more than 300 recipes, from simple barley bread for the workers to very elaborate, spiced cakes with honey for the palaces and temples.\nThe date palm was one of the first cultivated trees. It was domesticated in Mesopotamia more than 5,000 years ago. It grew abundantly in the Fertile Crescent and it was so productive (an average date palm produces 50 kg (100 lbs) of fruit a year for 60 years or more) that dates were the cheapest of staple foods. Because they were so valuable, they were well recorded in Assyrian and Babylonian monuments and temples. The villagers in Mesopotamia dried them and ate them as sweets. Whether fresh, soft-dried or hard-dried, they helped to give character to meat dishes and grain pies. They were valued by travelers for their energy and were recommended as stimulants against fatigue.\nFigs were also prized in early Mesopotamia, Palestine, Israel, and Egypt where their daily use was probably greater than or equal to that of dates. As well as appearing in wall paintings, many specimens have been found in Egyptian tombs as funerary offerings. In Greece and Crete, figs grew very readily and they were the staple of poor and rich alike, particularly in their dried form.\nGrape cultivation first began in Armenia and the eastern regions of the Mediterranean in the 4th century BC. Raisins were produced by drying grapes in the hot desert sun. Very quickly, viticulture and raisin production spread across northern Africa including Morocco and Tunisia. The Phoenicians and the Egyptians popularized the production of raisins, probably due to the perfect arid environment for sun drying. They put them in jars for storage and allotted them to the different temples by the thousands. They also added them to breads and various pastries, some made with honey, some with milk and eggs.\nFrom the Middle East, these fruits spread through Greece to Italy where they became a major part of the diet. Ancient Romans consumed raisins in spectacular quantities and at all levels of society, including them as a key part of their common meals, along with olives and fresh fruits. Raisined breads were common for breakfast and were consumed with their grains, beans, and cultured milks. Raisins were so valued that they transcended the food realm and became rewards for successful athletes, as well as premium barter currency.\nHaving dried fruits was essential in ancient Rome as these instructions for housekeepers around 100 BC tell: \"She must keep a supply of cooked food on hand for you and the servants. She must keep many hens and have plenty of eggs. She must have a large store of dried pears, sorbs, figs, raisins, sorbs in must, preserved pears and grapes and quinces. She must also keep preserved grapes in grape-pulp and in pots buried in the ground, as well as fresh Praenestine nuts kept in the same way, and Scantian quinces in jars, and other fruits that are usually preserved, as well as wild fruits. All these she must store away diligently every year.\"\nFigs were also extremely popular in Rome. Dried figs were added to bread and formed a major part of the winter food of country people. They were rubbed with spices such as cumin, anise and fennel seeds, or toasted sesame, wrapped in fig leaves and stored in jars. Today, major producing regions include Israel, Jerusalem, Gaza and many other Arabic countries. Dried figs are rich in vitamins, phosphorus and various other important minerals.\nPlums, apricots and peaches had their origins in Asia. They were domesticated in China in the 3rd millennium BC and spread to the Fertile Crescent where they were also very popular, fresh and dried alike. They arrived in Greece and Italy much later and were very expensive but valued in the preparation of gourmet dishes with port or stewed with honey and spices.", "response": "Early civilizations used dates, date juice evaporated into syrup and raisins as sweeteners.

{"instruction": "Given a reference text about the rock band Pink Floy: What was the name of Pink Floyd's last album and when was it released?", "context": "Pink Floyd are an English rock band formed in London in 1965. Gaining an early following as one of the first British psychedelic groups, they were distinguished by their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows. They became a leading band of the progressive rock genre, cited by some as the greatest progressive rock band of all time.\n\nPink Floyd were founded in 1965 by Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals), and Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals). Under Barrett's leadership, they released two charting singles and the successful debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). The guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in January 1968; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the concepts behind Pink Floyd's most successful albums, The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979). The musical film based on The Wall, Pink Floyd \u2013 The Wall (1982), won two BAFTA Awards. Pink Floyd also composed several film scores.\n\nFollowing personal tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1981, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd, rejoined later by Wright. They produced the albums A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994), backed by major tours, before entering a long hiatus. In 2005, all but Barrett reunited for a performance at the global awareness event Live 8. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless River (2014), was based on unreleased material from the Division Bell recording sessions. In 2022, Gilmour and Mason reformed Pink Floyd to release the song \"Hey, Hey, Rise Up!\" in protest of the Russo-Ukrainian War.\n\nBy 2013, Pink Floyd had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and these albums and Wish You Were Here are among the best-selling albums of all time. Four Pink Floyd albums topped the US Billboard 200, and five topped the UK Albums Chart. Pink Floyd's hit singles include \"See Emily Play\" (1967), \"Money\" (1973), \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\" (1979), \"Not Now John\" (1983), \"On the Turning Away\" (1987) and \"High Hopes\" (1994).

{"instruction": "What are some important points about the Battle of the Bulge?", "context": "The Battle of the Bulge, also known as the Ardennes Offensive, was the last major German offensive campaign on the Western Front during World War II. The battle lasted for five weeks from 16 December 1944 to 28 January 1945, towards the end of the war in Europe. It was launched through the densely forested Ardennes region between Belgium and Luxembourg. It overlapped with the Alsace Offensive, subsequently the Colmar Pocket, another series of battles launched by the Germans in support of the Ardennes thrust.\n\nThe primary military objectives were to deny further use of the Belgian Port of Antwerp to the Allies and to split the Allied lines, which potentially could have allowed the Germans to encircle and destroy the four Allied forces. The Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, who since December 1941 had assumed direct command of the German army, believed that achieving these objectives would compel the Western Allies to accept a peace treaty in the Axis powers' favor. By this time, it was palpable to virtually the entire German leadership including Hitler himself that they had no realistic hope of repelling the imminent Soviet invasion of Germany unless the Wehrmacht was able to concentrate the entirety of its remaining forces on the Eastern Front, which in turn obviously required that hostilities on the Western and Italian Fronts be terminated. The Battle of the Bulge remains among the most important battles of the war, as it marked the last major offensive attempted by the Axis Powers on the Western front. After their defeat, Germany would retreat for the remainder of the war.\n\nThe Germans achieved a total surprise attack on the morning of 16 December 1944, due to a combination of Allied overconfidence, preoccupation with Allied offensive plans, and poor aerial reconnaissance due to bad weather. American forces bore the brunt of the attack. The Germans attacked a weakly defended section of the Allied line, taking advantage of heavily overcast weather conditions that grounded the Allies' superior air forces. Fierce American resistance on the northern shoulder of the offensive, around Elsenborn Ridge, and in the south, around Bastogne, blocked German access to key roads to the northwest and west that they counted on for success. Columns of armor and infantry that were supposed to advance along parallel routes found themselves on the same roads. This congestion, and terrain that favored the defenders, threw the German advance behind schedule and allowed the Allies to reinforce the thinly placed troops.\n\nThe farthest west the offensive reached was the village of Foy-N\u00f4tre-Dame, south east of Dinant, being stopped by the U.S. 2nd Armored Division on 24 December 1944. Improved weather conditions from around 24 December permitted air attacks on German forces and supply lines, which sealed the failure of the offensive. On 26 December the lead element of Patton's U.S. Third Army reached Bastogne from the south, ending the siege. Although the offensive was effectively broken by 27 December, when the trapped units of 2nd Panzer Division made two break-out attempts with only partial success, the battle continued for another month before the front line was effectively restored to its position prior to the attack. In the wake of the defeat, many experienced German units were out of men and equipment, and the survivors retreated to the Siegfried Line.\n\nThe Germans' initial attack involved around 410,000 men; just over 1,400 tanks, tank destroyers, and assault guns; 2,600 artillery pieces; and over 1,000 combat aircraft, as well as large numbers of other armored fighting vehicles (AFVs). These were reinforced a couple of weeks later, bringing the offensive's total strength to around 450,000 troops, and 1,500 tanks and assault guns. Between 63,222 and 103,900 of these men were killed, missing, wounded in action, or captured. The battle severely depleted Germany's armored forces, which remained largely unreplaced throughout the remainder of the war. German Luftwaffe personnel, and later also Luftwaffe aircraft (in the concluding stages of the engagement) also sustained heavy losses.\n\nFrom among the Americans' peak strength of 610,000 troops there were 75,500 battle casualties, including about 8,400 killed. The \"Bulge\" was the largest and bloodiest single battle fought by the United States in World War II and the third-deadliest campaign in American history.", "response": "\u2022 The Battle of the Bulge, also known as the Ardennes Offensive, was the last major German offensive campaign on the Western Front during World War II.\n\u2022 The battle lasted for five weeks from 16 December 1944 to 28 January 1945, towards the end of the war in Europe.\n\u2022 The primary military objectives were to deny further use of the Belgian Port of Antwerp to the Allies and to split the Allied lines, which potentially could have allowed the Germans to encircle and destroy the four Allied forces.\n\u2022 The Germans achieved a total surprise attack on the morning of 16 December 1944, due to a combination of Allied overconfidence, preoccupation with Allied offensive plans, and poor aerial reconnaissance due to bad weather.\n\u2022 The farthest west the offensive reached was the village of Foy-N\u00f4tre-Dame, south east of Dinant, being stopped by the U.S. 2nd Armored Division on 24 December 1944.\n\u2022 On 26 December the lead element of Patton's U.S. Third Army reached Bastogne from the south, ending the siege.\n\u2022 The battle severely depleted Germany's armored forces, which remained largely unreplaced throughout the remainder of the war.\n\u2022 The \"Bulge\" was the largest and bloodiest single battle fought by the United States in World War II and the third-deadliest campaign in American history.", "category": "summarization"}

In Canada, the term automated banking machine (ABM) is also used, although ATM is also very commonly used in Canada, with many Canadian organizations using ATM over ABM. In British English, the terms cashpoint, cash machine and hole in the wall are most widely used. Other terms include any time money, cashline, tyme machine, cash dispenser, cash corner, bankomat, or bancomat. ATMs that are not operated by a financial institution are known as \"white-label\" ATMs.\n\nUsing an ATM, customers can access their bank deposit or credit accounts in order to make a variety of financial transactions, most notably cash withdrawals and balance checking, as well as transferring credit to and from mobile phones. ATMs can also be used to withdraw cash in a foreign country. If the currency being withdrawn from the ATM is different from that in which the bank account is denominated, the money will be converted at the financial institution's exchange rate. Customers are typically identified by inserting a plastic ATM card (or some other acceptable payment card) into the ATM, with authentication being by the customer entering a personal identification number (PIN), which must match the PIN stored in the chip on the card (if the card is so equipped), or in the issuing financial institution's database.", "category": "open_qa"}

It is bordered to the north by the Gulf of Finland across from Finland, to the west by the sea across from Sweden, to the south by Latvia, and to the east by Lake Peipus and Russia. The territory of Estonia consists of the mainland, the larger islands of Saaremaa and Hiiumaa, and over 2,200 other islands and islets on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea, covering a total area of 45,339 square kilometres (17,505 sq mi). The capital city Tallinn and Tartu are the two largest urban areas of the country. The Estonian language is the autochthonous and the official language of Estonia; it is the first language of the majority of its population, as well as the world's second most spoken Finnic language. The land of what is now modern Estonia has been inhabited by Homo sapiens since at least 9,000 BC. The medieval indigenous population of Estonia was one of the last pagan civilisations in Europe to adopt Christianity following the Papal-sanctioned Livonian Crusade in the 13th century. After centuries of successive rule by the Teutonic Order, Denmark, Sweden, and the Russian Empire, a distinct Estonian national identity began to emerge in the mid-19th century. This culminated in the 24 February 1918 Estonian Declaration of Independence from the then warring Russian and German Empires. Democratic throughout most of the interwar period, Estonia declared neutrality at the outbreak of World War II, but the country was repeatedly contested, invaded and occupied, first by the Soviet Union in 1940, then by Nazi Germany in 1941, and was ultimately reoccupied in 1944 by, and annexed into, the USSR as an administrative subunit (Estonian SSR). Throughout the 1944\u20131991 Soviet occupation, Estonia's de jure state continuity was preserved by diplomatic representatives and the government-in-exile. Following the bloodless Estonian \"Singing Revolution\" of 1988\u20131990, the nation's de facto independence from the Soviet Union was restored on 20 August 1991. Estonia is a developed country, with a high-income advanced economy. The sovereign state of Estonia is a democratic unitary parliamentary republic, administratively subdivided into 15 maakond (counties). With a population of just over 1.3 million, it is one of the least populous members of the European Union, the Eurozone, the OECD, the Schengen Area, and NATO.

When used wisely, GIS can help us livehealthier, wealthier, and safer lives. Each GIS user may decide what features and attributes are important. For example, forests are good for us. They may protect water supplies, yield wood, harbor wildlife,and provide space to recreate.We are concerned about the level of harvest, the adjacent land use, pollution from nearby industries, or where forests burn. Informed management requires knowledge of all these related factors and, perhaps above all, the spatial arrangement of these factors. Buffer strips near rivers may protect water supplies,clearings may prevent the spread of fire, and polluters upwind may harm our forests. A GIS helps us analyze these spatial interactions, and is also particularly useful at displaying spatial data and analysis.

{"instruction": "In golf, what is the proper technique when hitting a bunker shot? Assume the bunker is green adjacent.", "context": "", "response": "If the bunker is near the pin, use your sand-wedge.  Also, ensure you properly examined the green, to understand its shape and slope.  Combine this with an understanding of your own skill levels to make a decision on where you wish the ball to land.  For example,  the more skilled you are at these shots, the more precise a location you can identify.  Conversely, the less skilled you are, the less precise you can be in your chosen location, and consequently the more you need to consider a range of potential directions.  In those latter cases, it is best to aim towards the middle of the green rather than the exact placement of the pin.  Once you've made a decision on location, go up to your ball in the bunker.  (Pro-tip: don't forget to bring the rake with you).  Choose an open stance, where your legs are aiming roughly 45 degrees more to the left of the selected landing location.  If you're left-handed, the reverse is true, and your legs are aiming to the right of the intended direction/location.  Dig your shoes roughly an inch into the sand, to get a solid footing.  Next, bring your club face down to the ball, without actually touching the sand (it is not legal to make contact with the sand prior to contact with the ball).  Open the club face so that it aims towards the intended location.  Look one more time at the intended direction, then look down at the ball, and commence your backswing.  The plane of your backswing should be out, inline with the direction of your legs, and roughly three quarters the length of a full swing.  Firmly and confidently accelerate in your downswing, and aim to make contact with the sand roughly half an inch behind the ball.  The sand between the ball and the club head will blunt some of the force from the swing, thereby reducing ball travel distance, while still conveying spin.  A well hit shot can cause the ball to land on the green and immediately stop, possibly even moving back in the direction of the player.  The force in the downswing, combined with the amount of sand caught by the club head, are significant contributors to the amount of backspin on the ball.  Once you're done. rake up your marks as you exit the bunker, leaving no trace that you were ever there.", "category": "creative_writing"}

Jiang was paramount leader of China from 1989 to 2002. He was the core leader of the third generation of Chinese leadership, one of four core leaders alongside Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping and Xi Jinping.\n\nBorn in Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Jiang joined the CCP while he was in college. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, he received training at the Stalin Automobile Works in Moscow in the 1950s, later returning to Shanghai in 1962 to serve in various institutes, later being sent between 1970-1972 to Romania as part of an expert team to establish machinery manufacturing plants in the country. After 1979, he was appointed as the vice chair of two commissions by vice premier Gu Mu to oversee the newly-established special economic zones (SEZs). He became the vice minister of the newly-established Ministry of Electronics Industry and a member of the CCP Central Committee in 1982.\n\nJiang was appointed as the mayor of Shanghai in 1985, later being promoted to its Communist Party secretary, as well as a member of the CCP Politburo, in 1987. Jiang came to power unexpectedly as a compromise candidate following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, when he replaced Zhao Ziyang as CCP general secretary after Zhao was ousted for his support for the student movement. As the involvement of the \"Eight Elders\" in Chinese politics steadily declined, Jiang consolidated his hold on power to become the \"paramount leader\" in the country during the 1990s. Urged by Deng Xiaoping's southern tour in 1992, Jiang officially introduced the term \"socialist market economy\" in his speech during the 14th CCP National Congress held later that year, which accelerated \"opening up and reform\".\n\nUnder Jiang's leadership, China experienced substantial economic growth with the continuation of market reforms. The returning of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997 and of Macau from Portugal in 1999, and entry into the World Trade Organisation in 2001, were landmark moments of his era. China also witnessed improved relations with the outside world, while the Communist Party maintained its tight control over the state. Jiang faced criticism over human rights abuses, including the crackdown on the Falun Gong movement. His contributions to party doctrine, known as the \"Three Represents\", were written into the CCP constitution in 2002. Jiang gradually vacated his official leadership titles from 2002 to 2005, being succeeded in these roles by Hu Jintao, although he and his political faction continued to influence affairs until much later.

{"instruction": "What are some defining qualities of authoritarianism?", "context": "Authoritarianism is a political system characterized by the rejection of political plurality, the use of strong central power to preserve the political status quo, and reductions in the rule of law, separation of powers, and democratic voting. Political scientists have created many typologies describing variations of authoritarian forms of government. Authoritarian regimes may be either autocratic or oligarchic and may be based upon the rule of a party or the military. States that have a blurred boundary between democracy and authoritarianism have some times been characterized as \"hybrid democracies\", \"hybrid regimes\" or \"competitive authoritarian\" states.\n\nThe political scientist Juan Linz, in an influential 1964 work, An Authoritarian Regime: Spain, defined authoritarianism as possessing four qualities:\n\nLimited political pluralism, is realized with constraints on the legislature, political parties and interest groups.\nPolitical legitimacy is based upon appeals to emotion and identification of the regime as a necessary evil to combat \"easily recognizable societal problems, such as underdevelopment or insurgency.\"\nMinimal political mobilization, and suppression of anti-regime activities.\nIll-defined executive powers, often vague and shifting extend the power of the executive.\nMinimally defined, an authoritarian government lacks free and competitive direct elections to legislatures, free and competitive direct or indirect elections for executives, or both. Broadly defined, authoritarian states include countries that lack civil liberties such as freedom of religion, or countries in which the government and the opposition do not alternate in power at least once following free elections. Authoritarian states might contain nominally democratic institutions such as political parties, legislatures and elections which are managed to entrench authoritarian rule and can feature fraudulent, non-competitive elections. In contexts of democratic backsliding, scholars tend to identify authoritarian political leaders based on certain tactics, such as: politicizing independent institutions, spreading disinformation, aggrandizing executive power, quashing dissent, targeting vulnerable communities, stoking violence, and corrupting elections.

{"instruction": "What are some of the challenges and solutions involved in growing tomatoes in the Pacific Northwest?", "context": "", "response": "Growing tomatoes in the Pacific Northwest is very possible, but can present a number of challenges. The three biggest concerns revolve around:\n\n1. A short growing season\n2. Cooler summers\n3. Wetter than average summers\n\nHere are some solutions you can use to mitigate these challenges.\n\nDo deal with the short growing season, you need to get a headstart on growing by using starters. What this means is that instead of planting a seed in the ground in Springtime, you start a seed indoors in late winter, grow it into a small to medium plant, then transplant that \"starter\", into the ground when the temperature is warm enough. You can buy starters from Nurseries, or start your own at home. Nursery starters are easier, but by growing at home you can experiment with more rare varieties and gain experience in cultivating a plant from the seedling stage. If you grow your own it's important to slowly climatize the plant to outdoor weather leading up to the transplant date by moving it outside starting with a couple hours a day, increasing an hour or two per day over 2-3 weeks. By using starters you essentially extend the growing season by giving your plant a multi month head start. \n\nTomatoes mature best in warm to hot climates. The pacific northwest has cooler summers than many of the growing regions in the world. There is not a lot we can do to control mother nature, but there are one or two methods to help yourself here. Certain varieties of tomatoes do better in cooler summers - try and select these. If you're using starts from a local nursery they can guide you - starts from big national box stores might not be the best for your local Northwest climate. Another technique, if you are experiencing a cooler than normal Spring and start of Summer, is to build a \"hoop house\", using PVC pipe frame and a visqueen tarp. This will let light in and act as a mini-greenhouse, trapping heat around the plant. Keep in mind tomatoes need pollinators like bees to produce fruit, so once the plan t begins to flower you'll want to ensure pollination can occur.\n\nMoisture creates issues with Tomato plants as they are very susceptible to various types of fungus that grow on the leaves. Blight is one in particular common among tomatoes. The wet summers we sometimes have create conditions on the leaves conducive to fungal growth, they can also splash fungus onto the leaves from the soil. The easiest way to deal with these two issues is in proper pruning. As early as you can prune any lower sets of leaves that could possibly come into contact with the ground. Don't do this too soon as the plant needs some leaves to grow. There are many ways to prune a tomato that you can read about, but one common one in wet areas is called single stemming - in this technique you prune \"suckers\", which are the small offshoots that grow in between the main stem and the leaf stems. By pruning the suckers you prevent too much bushy growth, which will help the leaves dry out with airflow after a rain storm. The last issue related to water is that heavy late season rains will cause the fruits to swell with water and crack. There's not an easy solution here. If it's towards the end of the season and a rainstorm is coming in, this can be a good time to pick all your fruit, your green tomatoes can be used for green salsas. Some will resort to building a tarp structure above the plants to stop the rain, though this can require a bit more work and ingenuity, and you'll need another system to keep the plants watered.\n\nOverall, growing tomatoes in the Pacific Northwest is totally possible and very rewarding. Hopefully these tips help you to have a fruitful growing season!", "category": "general_qa"}

Your liver makes cholesterol and it is also found in some foods like meat and dairy products. Your body needs certain levels of cholesterol to function, but too much raises the risk of  cardiovascular disease. \n\nLDL, low-density lipoprotein, is also known as bad cholesterol. It gets it's \"bad\" name because too high of levels of LDL can lead to a build up of cholesterol in you arteries.  The extra amount of LDL forms plaque and the build up of this plaque in your arteries leads to a condition called, artherosclerosis.  Coronary artery disease happens when the plaque buildup is in the arteries of your heart. It causes the arteries to become hardened and narrowed , which slows down or blocks the blood flow to your heart.  Because your blood carries oxygen to your heart, this means that your heart may not be able to get enough oxygen.

The difference in mass between the reactants and products is manifested as either the release or absorption of energy. This difference in mass arises due to the difference in nuclear binding energy between the atomic nuclei before and after the reaction. Nuclear fusion is the process that powers active or main-sequence stars and other high-magnitude stars, where large amounts of energy are released.\n\nA nuclear fusion process that produces atomic nuclei lighter than iron-56 or nickel-62 will generally release energy. These elements have a relatively small mass and a relatively large binding energy per nucleon. Fusion of nuclei lighter than these releases energy (an exothermic process), while the fusion of heavier nuclei results in energy retained by the product nucleons, and the resulting reaction is endothermic. The opposite is true for the reverse process, called nuclear fission. Nuclear fusion uses lighter elements, such as hydrogen and helium, which are in general more fusible; while the heavier elements, such as uranium, thorium and plutonium, are more fissionable.

{"instruction": "What is \"woke\" and why is it so controversial?", "context": "", "response": "Woke is a general political term used to group a set of similar ideologies in an attempt to characterize the political motivations typically ascribed to the far left. Although many definitions of woke exist, these definitions run along a few common threads. Woke is typically used to describe the ideals underpinning what is known as equality of outcome. This is to be contrasted with the opposing political forces who support equality of opportunity.\n\nThose who engage in wokeness more often than not cite disparities as evidence of systemic biases or expressions of racism, sexism, classism, genderism, agism and other prejudices. A common example would be that females are disproportionately represented in elementary school teaching whereas males are disproportionately represented in railroad construction. Woke politics would lead us to believe that this is evidence of sexism: women and men are socialized differently so they are pushed into different positions by institutions. Woke opponents would lead us to believe this is evidence of inate preferences different between the sexes: males are generally stronger than females, so men are more suited to performing heavy labor.\n\nWokeness is controversial because its opponents do not believe disparity is evidence of bias. Disparities can exist due to natural or cultural differences, neither of which can be governed out of existence. The opponents of woke ideology also proclaim that it ignores the root cause of problems which plague society. If one's analysis stops at disparity and from disparity an answer is assumed, one can miss the nuances present in a situation. A common unavoidable disparity cited is that 100% of births are to females, but this is not sexism. Analysis past disparity is required to prove or disprove systemic or individual bias.", "category": "open_qa"}

For example, a \"dry\" snow from a very cold storm might land directly on top of a sun-baked layer which turned to ice. The point at which these layers meet is called an interface, and is where slipping or sliding of one layer on top of another is most likely to occur. This occurrence is what can trigger an avalanche.

{"instruction": "What is a triathlon?", "context": "", "response": "A triathlon is a sport that combines three different events: swimming, biking and running, in that order.

Triathlons differ based on distance and terrain. They can be as short as a sprint event, which might include a swim as short as a single lap in a pool, or as long as an ironman triathlon, which includes a 2.4-mile swim, 112 miles of biking, and a full marathon. A common triathlon distance in between a spring and ironman is the olympic triathlon, which includes a 1.5-kilometer swim, 40 kilometer bike ride, and 10 kilometer run.

It is painted in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel. Leonardo never gave the painting to the Giocondo family, and it is believed he later left it in his will to his favored apprentice Sala\u00ec. It was believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. It was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French Republic.

The game of lacrosse is based on the traditional Native American game \"baggataway.\"'  This means \"little brother of war;\" it was also commonly referred to as \"The Creator's Game.\"  There are currently three predominant versions of lacrosse: Field Lacrosse, Box Lacrosse, and Women's Lacrosse.  \nField lacrosse is the men's outdoor version of the game.  There are 10 players on each team, on the field at once.  These players consist of 3 attackmen, 3 midfielders, 3 defensemen, and one goalie.  Each player has a helmet, shoulder pads, gloves, elbow pads, and a lacrosse stick.  6 players carry a short stick, which measures between 40 to 42 inches, and a maximum of four players on the field at a time can carry a long stick, which is between 52 and 72 inches long.  Short sticks are generally used by offensive players, and long sticks by defensive only players.  The goalie has a specific stick to his position, with a. wider \"head\" to assist in making saves.  The ball for play is made of solid rubber, about the size of a baseball.  A lacrosse goal measures 6 feet by 6 feet.  Teams are awarded one point for getting the ball into the goal.  \nEach game is 60 minutes long, made up of four 15 minute periods.  At the start of each period, and after ever goal, there is a face-off at the center of the field.  A unique aspect of lacrosse is that on a shot, when the ball goes out of bounds, possession is awarded to the team closet to the ball when it went out.  On out of bounds other than a shot attempt, possession is awarded to the opposite team that touched it last.  During the course of play teams may substitute players \"on the fly,\" through a designated substitution area (commonly referred to as \"the box\"), which is in between the benches of both teams.\nPenalties in lacrosse result from rule violations, deemed by either an infraction (commonly referred to as a \"technical foul\"), or a personal foul.  The result of the offending team is either losing possession of the ball, or temporarily losing a player for a designated period of time (similar to hockey).  The offending player serves their penalty in the box.  The team that has taken the penalty is the playing \"man-down\" for the time serving portion of the rule violation, while the other team is player \"man-up.\"\nThe generally consensus for who the greatest lacrosse player of all time is usually between three players: Jim Brown, Gary Gait, and John Grant.", "category": "general_qa"}

After being teamless for another 4 months, he joined Newbee in the Summer of 2018.\n\nIn 2018 WCS Montreal, Oliveira reached a new milestone in his SC2 career. He never expected himself to go that deep into the tournament. Oliveira defeated Has 3:2, who was the runner-up of 2018 WCS Valencia, and he advanced to the quarterfinals. In Ro8, he surprised most people by sweeping the series against HeRoMaRinE, one of the best EU Terran players, 3:0. Before him, the Chinese audience had sorely missed one of their own players in the semifinals, the last two being MacSed & Jim in 2013. Even though Reynor ended Oliveira's journey, he had a bright future in the coming years.\n\nOn April 2019, despite losing to MaSa in 2019 WCS Winter AM, Oliveira saw his 4th trip to the Top 8 of a premier tournament.\n\nJust one month after 2019 WCS Winter AM, Oliveira made his breakthrough and stood in front of Serral in the quarterfinals of 2019 WCS Spring. Even though he felt anxious while facing the world's best player, Oliveira still managed to grab one map after an unsuccessful Nydus timing attack from Serral. He said that he had seen the gap between him and the best player and what he could improve in the next tournament after that game.\n\nOn July 2019, Oliveira was defeated by ShoWTimE, the best German Protoss, 1:3 in the quarterfinals of 2019 WCS Summer. Later, he was successfully qualified for Assembly Summer 2019 after defeating Scarlett for the first time. He got revenge against ShoWTimE in Group Stage 2 with two decisive SCV pulls. He then faced Serral in the quarterfinals for the second time and showed his improvement after 3 months' practice. No one expected that Oliveira would almost take down Serral in this BO5, but he narrowly lost 2:3. He even led 2:1 in the series but Serral pulled off a comeback after a vigorous effort and defeated Oliveira with 3:2. During the winner's interview, the reigning WCS Champion said that there was a moment he thought he might have lost the game. Oliveira showed his excellent control just like what ByuN did 3 years ago, and earned himself many fans worldwide.\n\nOn Aug 15, 2019 GSL vs. the World, he dominated one of the best Zerg players from Korea, soO. There was no doubt that Oliveira was now one of the best Terran players in the world.\n\nAfter defeating MaNa 3:1 and Astrea 3:0 in 2019 WCS Fall, Oliveira became the first Mainland Chinese player to qualify for 2019 WCS Global Finals in Anaheim. It had taken 8 years for Chinese fans to see a local player competing in the Global Finals for the first time. No matter the result, Oliveira had initiated a new era for the Chinese StarCraft 2 scene.\n\nWinning IEM Katowice 2023\nIn one of the biggest upsets in Starcraft II history, Oliveira defeated Maru 4:1 in the Grand Final of IEM Katowice 2023 to become the 2023 World Champion. After narrowly escaping his group with a 2-3 overall record with only beating Terrans, he beat 2022 IEM Katowice Semifinalist HeRoMaRinE, 2021 IEM Katowice Champion Reynor and 2022 Season 2 GSL Code S Champion herO to reach the finals. His opponent in that match, 5-time GSL Code S Champion Maru, was the 94% favourite according to Aligulac and won the first map in a convincing fashion.

{"instruction": "Is plastic bad for us?", "context": "", "response": "Have you ever thought about where your plastic water bottles go? It probably ends up in a landfill, where it will decompose for over 1000 years as it deposits toxic chemicals. Plastic is an invention that has done more harm than good. There are about 363,762,732,605 pounds of plastic covering the earth. Most of this plastic can\u2019t be recycled. Although people think it is too expensive or inconvenient to get rid of plastics, we should reduce the amount of plastic used or increase the price of plastics.\u00a0One reason is that when plastic invades a balanced ecosystem, it corrupts it completely. The marine biome is one that is affected by this product. The animals in the ocean die of suffocation, ingestion of plastics, and entanglement. The animals affected are seagulls, whales, seals, fish, and turtles, and that's just a few. The animals eat so much plastic that they die of constipation from it.\u00a0Another reason is the presence of microplastics in food and people. About 99% of fish have microplastics in their stomachs, livers, and filets (the meat of fish). Approximately 80% of cows have microplastics in their meat and milk. A good point is that mealworms and waxworms are studied to digest plastics, and they should be added to landfills to break down plastics. There are about 50,000 particles of plastic in an adult person, and this number is rising fast.\u00a0Third, most plastic is littered. There are about 10 million tons of plastic litter every year. Every week, you ingest about a credit card's worth of plastic. There are about 44 million pounds of plastic that are produced that is very deadly to the environment.\"The plastic in the environment is in your water, food, and body. These plastics should not be there; they can lead to cancer, according to a recent study. We need to stop using plastic in our lives.\u00a0Some ways we can reduce the amount of plastic on earth are by using sustainable materials such as wood, plant fibers, and mushroom styrofoam. We can also try to buy recyclable plastics that have a triangle formed by three cycling arrows. Use a tote bag instead of a plastic one, or a metal and glass straw instead of a plastic one. You can also use a metal cutlery kit instead of plastic. These are all ways you can make a difference in your everyday life.", "category": "general_qa"}

The book is recognized as a classic in children's literature, and is one of the best-selling books of all time with over 100 million copies sold.\n\nThe Hobbit is set in Middle-earth and follows home-loving Bilbo Baggins, the titular hobbit, who joins the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves that make up Thorin Oakenshield's Company, on a quest to reclaim the dwarves' home and treasure from the dragon Smaug. Bilbo's journey takes him from his peaceful rural surroundings into more sinister territory.\n\nThe story is told in the form of an episodic quest, and most chapters introduce a specific creature or type of creature of Tolkien's geography. Bilbo gains a new level of maturity, competence, and wisdom by accepting the disreputable, romantic, fey, and adventurous sides of his nature and applying his wits and common sense. The story reaches its climax in the Battle of Five Armies, where many of the characters and creatures from earlier chapters re-emerge to engage in conflict.\n\nPersonal growth and forms of heroism are central themes of the story, along with motifs of warfare. These themes have led critics to view Tolkien's own experiences during World War I as instrumental in shaping the story. The author's scholarly knowledge of Germanic philology and interest in mythology and fairy tales are often noted as influences.\n\nThe publisher was encouraged by the book's critical and financial success and, therefore, requested a sequel. As Tolkien's work progressed on its successor, The Lord of the Rings, he made retrospective accommodations for it in The Hobbit. These few but significant changes were integrated into the second edition. Further editions followed with minor emendations, including those reflecting Tolkien's changing concept of the world into which Bilbo stumbled.\n\nThe work has never been out of print.

{"instruction": "What is the concept of a good life according to Socrates and Aristotle, and what are the components that contribute to it? Is a good life innate or learned, and can anyone achieve it?", "context": "", "response": "One of the most tantalizing and theorized about topics is that of the meaning of life and how to live a \u201cgood\u201d one. It is human nature to explain the unknown and create explanations for the way the world works; throughout history philosophers have come to their own conclusions on why some lives are good and others are not. Two key figures that lend insight in these respects are Socrates in Plato\u2019s The Apology, and Aristotle in Nicomachean Ethics. A seemingly simple concept quickly devolves into a confusing and complex web of components that only together in the right proportions lend each man or woman a full good life. In order to discuss the way in which we are to lead a good life we must first discuss the differing factors that contribute to the definition of good in the eyes of Socrates and Aristotle. What are the components of the concept of good? Is it innate or learned? Can it be purchased? Is it temporary or is it eternal? Does it apply to one\u2019s self or a community as a whole? Does one conduct oneself to be good? How Is a good life given by the gods or earned by humans? And although there is no definitive answer to any of these questions, in both author\u2019s texts living a good life comes down to the choices you make and how they compare to the definition of good you subscribe to. Socrates and Aristotle use words such as virtue, courage, happiness, and intelligence to describe their versions of the path you take to reach a good life, and all are important, but the main driver of a good life is one\u2019s ability to find the proper equilibrium between\nDahlke 1\n each of their characteristics that lend towards the development of a commonly defined good life.\nTheorizing on how to live a good life leads to the necessity of defining what a good life is and the components that make it up. Aristotle theorized in Nicomachean Ethics that the idea of virtue, or excellence, can be an overarching theme for the components that make up the highest \u201cgood\u201d, the good that is an endpoint or product encompassing the entire life before it. And the development of virtue lies within a midpoint between too much and too little of any emotion, action or characteristic.\n... it is in emotions and actions that excess, deficiency and the median are found. Thus we can experience fear confidence, desire, anger, pity and generally any kind of pleasure and pain either too much or too little, and in either case not properly. But to experience all this at the right time, towards the right objects, towards the right people, for the right reason, and in the right manner \u2014 that is the median and the best course, the course that is a mark of virtue. (Aristotle. Bk. 2, pg. 43)\nAnd still, even with the most precise definition Aristotle or Socrates gives there is a great amount of ambiguity. While some characteristics or actions are classified as inherently good or bad Aristotle theorizes that simply over exercising the usage of one or two characteristics doesn\u2019t mean you are a good person living a good life. But rather, he states that there is a median usage point between the extrema of never and always that contributes to virtue, and then a good life. Where that point is is still unknown, partly due to the infinite situational differences one person can have versus another person\nDahlke 2\n\n during their lifetime and partly due to the complexity and magnitude of the variables that contribute to the person as a whole. However, Aristotle goes into a few overarching descriptors of his definition of a virtuous man or woman to help define the median between the two extrema. For example, the median for pleasure and pain is self control, between fear and confidence is courage, and righteous falls between envy and spite.1 These examples shine a light on how to find the middle between two opposing qualities, but do not instruct on how we are to lead a good life. While definitively defining the idea of good is complex the framework of thought to use when faced with daily decisions Aristotle provides allows for the discussion on how to live a good life.\nCreating a structured plan for how to live a good life brings about the question can anyone live a good life? Furthermore, are the segments that complete virtue innate or are they learned? Aristotle delves into two schools of thought, the first being that there are some characteristics that born with can impede or halt one\u2019s quest for moral virtue, and secondly, that one develops these traits over time and through ritual habit. The latter, he describes in analogy, \u201cSimilarly, we become just by the practice of just actions, self-controlled by exercising self-control, and courageous by performing acts of courage.\u201d (Aristotle. Bk. 2, pg. 34) In other words, one becomes virtuous by continually being virtuous. Therefore, one finds oneself in a good life when one habitually lives within the middle of all opposing qualities. While not everyone in a society will live a good life, everyone within a society can live a good life. At this point it is important to\n1 Examples given in Book II Ch. 7 - Nicomachean Ethics\nDahlke 3\n \n refer back to the definition of what a good life is, it does not mean success, fame or wealth, but rather practicing the combination of elements that create virtue.\nWhile some qualities like virtue are relatively undisputed as good, wealth is a heavily debated part of a good life. Both Aristotle and Socrates agree that wealth is not an indicator of a good life but their thought differs when it comes to the part money plays in the development of such a life. While Aristotle believes wealth is a necessity for aspects of a virtuous life, Socrates believes that wealth is only a byproduct of a good life. Aristotle does concede to saying that, \u201cwealth is not the good which we are trying to find, for it is only useful, i.e., it is a means to something else.\u201d (Aristotle. Bk. 1, pg. 9) Otherwise saying that while wealth is not the end goal and is meaningless when thinking of one\u2019s worth, it is helpful in the creation of a good life. On the other hand, Socrates writes of wealth as something that does not create excellence and at times can even inhibit it\u2019s development. In The Apology Socrates says to the jury, \u201cWealth does not bring about excellence, but excellence brings about wealth and all other public and private blessings for men.\u201d (Plato. 30b) While this quote is taken out of the context of a defensive argument, it still holds Socrates\u2019 beliefs on wealth. He, an impoverished man, does not find the same value in money as sophists like Aristotle, and while defending his choice to not charge a fee to the pupils that followed his philosophical thought like other sophists did, he said that he is here at the service to god. Both theories on wealth\u2019s role in a good life are important to consider. Does wealth lead to corruption and poverty to a more sinful life? Wealth, similarly to fear, needs a median. As Aristotle describes fear, too little is being reckless, while too much is being cowardly. In wealth the same thought\nDahlke 4\n\n can be applied, too little creates extreme poverty which distracts from living a virtuous life and too much can create different distractions that lead to the same result.\nAnother contesting theory is that of the length in which \u201cgoodness\u201d lasts. When defining a good life, it is important to think about when you can use good as a descriptor. If goodness in reference to one\u2019s life lasts forever then the term is permanent and can be applied throughout one's life. If on the contrary, goodness comes and goes throughout life the term can only be used temporarily or in posterity noting one\u2019s life as a whole. Socrates, after the announcement of his execution states, \u201ca good man cannot be harmed either in life or death, and that his affairs are not neglected by the gods.\u201d (Plato. 41 c-d) Lending the idea that a good man or woman living a good life is continuous and permanent, throughout life and death. However, Aristotle argues that since a good life is a sum of smaller goods, to use the term to describe someone's life, it must come at the end of their life, looking at it as a whole. After describing smaller goals and endpoints he goes further and says, \u201cThe highest good, on the other hand, must be something final\u201d (Aristotle. Bk. 1 pg. 14) Stating that while there are different branches of a good life, virtuous behavior is not a constant and therefore you cannot give a description to their life as a whole until it\u2019s end. Socrates\u2019 arguments on the length of goodness are rather naive, seeing as people change over time, only with the entire information of their lives can one make a claim as to whether or not they had a good life.\nIn summary, the two different views on how we are to live a good life together provide insight and theory into the subject but neither provides a complete instruction on doing so. Socrates, as written down by Plato, describes his own life which he\nDahlke 5\n\nconsiders to be a virtuous one and Aristotle provides a philosophical theory behind how to live in a virtuous way with the end goal of happiness or in other words a good life. The closest we can get to understanding how to live a good life is by understanding what makes up a good life, and even this is subjective. One person\u2019s views on what a virtuous life means can differ greatly from the next depending on where they lived, their religious beliefs, or social status. These variances result in many different guides to and definitions of a good life. Within all the different viewpoints, a concept introduced in Nicomachean Ethics that can be widely accepted is that within someone\u2019s life there is a median point between each of their emotions, actions and characteristics that create virtue and lead towards a good life.", "category": "creative_writing"}

{"instruction": "Without quoting directly from the text give me a summary the game of chess", "context": "Chess is a board game for two players, called White and Black, each controlling an army of chess pieces in their color, with the objective to checkmate the opponent's king. It is sometimes called international chess or Western chess to distinguish it from related games, such as xiangqi (Chinese chess) and shogi (Japanese chess). The recorded history of chess goes back at least to the emergence of a similar game, chaturanga, in seventh-century India. The rules of chess as we know them today emerged in Europe at the end of the 15th century, with standardization and universal acceptance by the end of the 19th century. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide.\n\nChess is an abstract strategy game that involves no hidden information and no use of dice or cards. It is played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. At the start, each player controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. White moves first, followed by Black. Checkmating the opponent's king involves putting the king under immediate attack (in \"check\") whereby there is no way for it to escape. There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.\n\nOrganized chess arose in the 19th century. Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE (the International Chess Federation). The first universally recognized World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886; Magnus Carlsen is the current World Champion. A huge body of chess theory has developed since the game's inception. Aspects of art are found in chess composition, and chess in its turn influenced Western culture and art, and has connections with other fields such as mathematics, computer science, and psychology.\n\nOne of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess-playing machine. In 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer to beat the reigning World Champion in a match when it defeated Garry Kasparov. Today's chess engines are significantly stronger than the best human players and have deeply influenced the development of chess theory.", "response": "Chess is a two player turn based abstract strategy board game with the goal of checkmating the opponents King. The game originated from a similar board game from India called Chatarunga, which was played during the 17th century.\n\nChess boards have 64 squares arranged into an 8x8 grid with alternating white and black squares. Each player controls 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 bishops, 2 rooks, 2 knights, and eight pawns. Each piece has a predefined mode of movement. Each player's pieces are uniformly colored; for example if player one has the white pieces, player one will start the match. \n\nCheckmating the opponents king requires the opponent to position their pieces into an attacking arrangement that prohibits the defending players king from moving. This is usually accomplished by closing in on their defending opponents king and systematically working towards positions where the king can no longer move without being taken. If the king is under attack (meaning the king is in a position where the opponents next move will take the king) the defensive player must either take the attacking piece with any piece on the board or move the king to a position where the king is no longer under attach, this configuration is called \"Check\" or being \"Checked\". Chess matches can also end in a draw.\n\nChess arose in popularity in the 19th century and is governed internationally by the FIDE (international chess federation). Magnus Carlsen is the current world champion (2023) and the game has a huge body of theory associated with playing the game. \n\nThe game has influenced western culture in the fields of art, mathematics, computer science and psychology.

{"instruction": "What is the story of the decline of Wang Computer?", "context": "Wang Labs was one of a large number of New England-based computer companies that faltered in the late 1980s and 1990s, marking the end of the Massachusetts Miracle. For instance, the struggling Digital Equipment Corporation also downsized in the 1990s and was acquired by Compaq.\n\nA common view within the PC community is that Wang Labs failed because it specialized in computers designed specifically for word processing and did not foresee and could not compete with general-purpose personal computers with word-processing software in the 1980s. Word processing was not actually the mainstay of Wang's business by the time desktop computers began to gain in popularity. Although Wang manufactured desktops, its main business by the 1980s was its VS line of minicomputer and \"midframe\" systems. The market for these minicomputers was conquered by enhanced microcomputers like the Apple Macintosh and the Wintel PC and Sun, IBM, and Hewlett-Packard servers.\n\nAn Wang's insistence that his son, Fred Wang, succeed him contributed to the company's failure. Fred Wang was a business school graduate, \"but by almost any definition\", wrote Charles C. Kenney, \"unsuited for the job in which his father had placed him.\" His assignment, first as head of research and development, then as president of the company, led to resignations by key R&D and business personnel. Amid declining revenues, John F. Cunningham, an 18-year employee of the firm, resigned as president and COO of Wang Labs to become chairman and chief executive of Computer Consoles Inc. Cunningham resigned due to disagreement with An Wang on how to pull the company out of the slump, as well as being upset that Fred Wang was positioned, nepotistically, as An Wang's successor.\n\nOne turning point occurred when Fred Wang was head of R&D. On October 4, 1983, Wang Laboratories announced fourteen major hardware and software products and promised dates of delivery. The announcement was well received, but even at the time, there were warning signs. According to Datamation, Wang announced \"everything but the kitchen sink. And if you could attach the kitchen sink to a personal computer, they would announce that too.\" Very few of the products were close to completion, and many of them had not even been started. All were delivered late, if at all. In retrospect, this was referred to as the \"vaporware announcement,\" and it hurt the credibility of Fred Wang and Wang Laboratories.\n\nIn 1986, Fred Wang, then 36 years old, was installed as president of Wang Laboratories. However, the company's fortunes continued to decline. Unlike most computer companies that funded their growth by issuing stock, An Wang had used debt to avoid further dilution of family control of the company. By August 1989, that debt was causing conflicts with its creditors. On August 4, 1989, An Wang fired his son. Richard W. Miller, who had been with the company since 1988, replaced him as the president of Wang Laboratories.\n\nMiller announced in December 1989 that the company would start to embrace established software standards rather than use traditional proprietary designs. An Wang died in March 1990, and Miller took on the additional posts of chairman and CEO. The company underwent massive restructuring and eliminated its bank debt in August 1990, but it still ended the year with a record net loss.\n\nIn November 1990, Wang announced their first personal computers running Unix. In 1987, Wang developed a new typesetting system in conjunction with Arlington, MA-based Texet Corp. The system used Xerox printers and UNIX workstations from Sun, but the product vanished before coming to market, because few Wang employees could use or support UNIX. UNIX ran on the VS \u2013 Interactive Systems first ported IN/ix (their IBM 360 version of SYS5 UNIX) to run in a VSOS Virtual machine circa 1985, and then Wang engineers completed the port so that it ran \"native\" on the VS hardware soon thereafter \u2013 but performance was always sub-par as UNIX was never a good fit for the batch-mode nature of the VS hardware, and the line-at-a-time processing approach taken by the VS workstations; indeed, the workstation code had to be rewritten to bundle up each keystroke into a frame to be sent back to the host when running UNIX so that \"tty\" style processing could be implemented. PACE, which offered its data dictionary, excellent referential integrity, and speedy application development, was in the process of being ported to UNIX under the name OPEN Pace. A client-server RDBMS model built on the original product's ideology, OPEN Pace was demonstrated at the North American PACE User Group Conferences in both Boston and Chicago. OPEN Pace, along with a new Windows-based word processor called UpWord (which was at the time considered a strong contender to retake Wang's original market leadership from Microsoft), were touted as their new direction. However, after a marketing study[citation needed] suggested that it would require large capital investments in order to be viable competitors against Microsoft, both products were abandoned.\n\nIra Magaziner, who was brought in by Miller in 1990, proposed to take Wang out of the manufacture of computers altogether, and to go big into imaging software instead. In March 1991, the company introduced its Office 2000 marketing strategy, focusing on office productivity.\n\nIn June 1991, Wang started reselling IBM computers, in exchange for IBM investing in Wang stock. Wang hardware strategy to re-sell IBM RS/6000s also included further pursuit of UNIX software.\n\nIn August 1991, Wang won a suit against NEC and Toshiba claiming violation of Wang's patents on single in-line memory modules (SIMMs). The company still recorded a net loss for the 1991 fiscal year.\n\nWang Laboratories filed for bankruptcy protection on August 18, 1992, at a time when the company's attempted concession from proprietary to open systems was deemed by some analysts as \"too little and too late", "response": "Founder An Wang forced his experienced son Fred Wang was going to lead the company after his death.", "category": "closed_qa"}

{"instruction": "Using examples taken from the text give me a rundown of the primary environments found in Yellowstone National Park.", "context": "Yellowstone National Park is an American national park located in the western United States, largely in the northwest corner of Wyoming and extending into Montana and Idaho. It was established by the 42nd U.S. Congress with the Yellowstone National Park Protection Act and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872. Yellowstone was the first national park in the U.S. and is also widely held to be the first national park in the world. The park is known for its wildlife and its many geothermal features, especially the Old Faithful geyser, one of its most popular. While it represents many types of biomes, the subalpine forest is the most abundant. It is part of the South Central Rockies forests ecoregion.\n\nWhile Native Americans have lived in the Yellowstone region for at least 11,000 years, aside from visits by mountain men during the early-to-mid-19th century, organized exploration did not begin until the late 1860s. Management and control of the park originally fell under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of the Interior, the first Secretary of the Interior to supervise the park being Columbus Delano. However, the U.S. Army was eventually commissioned to oversee the management of Yellowstone for 30 years between 1886 and 1916. In 1917, administration of the park was transferred to the National Park Service, which had been created the previous year. Hundreds of structures have been built and are protected for their architectural and historical significance, and researchers have examined more than a thousand archaeological sites.\n\nYellowstone National Park spans an area of 3,468.4 sq mi (8,983 km2), comprising lakes, canyons, rivers, and mountain ranges. Yellowstone Lake is one of the largest high-elevation lakes in North America and is centered over the Yellowstone Caldera, the largest super volcano on the continent. The caldera is considered a dormant volcano. It has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years. Well over half of the world's geysers and hydrothermal features are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism. Lava flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area of Yellowstone. The park is the centerpiece of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the largest remaining nearly-intact ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone. In 1978, Yellowstone was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nHundreds of species of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians have been documented, including several that are either endangered or threatened. The vast forests and grasslands also include unique species of plants. Yellowstone Park is the largest, and most famous megafauna location in the contiguous United States. Grizzly bears, cougars, wolves, and free-ranging herds of bison and elk live in this park. The Yellowstone Park bison herd is the oldest and largest public bison herd in the United States. Forest fires occur in the park each year; in the large forest fires of 1988, nearly one-third of the park was burnt. Yellowstone has numerous recreational opportunities, including hiking, camping, boating, fishing, and sightseeing. Paved roads provide close access to the major geothermal areas as well as some of the lakes and waterfalls. During the winter, visitors often access the park by way of guided tours that use either snow coaches or snowmobiles.", "response": "Generally considered to be the first national park in the world, Yellowstone National Park is significant in size, covering parts of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, and acts as the largest remaining nearly-intact ecosystems.  The park is able to support many types of wildlife including Grizzly bears, cougars, wolves, mountain goats, free-ranging herds of bison and elk, as well as many types of birds and fish, because of the diversity of habitats.  Forests and grasslands dominate some areas of the park, while others offer the completely different experience of mountain ranges, lakes, and rolling prairies.  Some of the park's most unique features are the geysers and hydrothermal features.  In fact, Yellowstone is home to over half of the world's features like these.  This is due to the entire park being centered over the Yellowstone Caldera, the largest super volcano on the continent.", "category": "summarization"}

(/\u02cclu\u02d0lu\u02c8l\u025bm\u0259n/; styled in all lowercase) is a Canadian multinational athletic apparel retailer headquartered in British Columbia and incorporated in Delaware, United States. It was founded in 1998 as a retailer of yoga pants and other yoga wear, and has expanded to also sell athletic wear, lifestyle apparel, accessories, and personal care products. The company has 574 stores internationally, and also sells online.\n\nHistory\nLululemon was founded in 1998 by Chip Wilson in Vancouver, with its first standalone store opening in November 2000. Wilson created the name to have many L's so that it would sound western to Japanese buyers, who often have difficulty pronouncing the letter. He later remarked that he found it \"funny to watch [Japanese speakers] try and say it\" and that \"it was the only reason behind the name\".\n\nThe company's initial public offering was in July 2007, raising $327.6 million by selling 18.2 million shares. Christine Day, a former co-president of Starbucks, became chief executive officer in 2008.\n\nIn 2013, the company made its third consecutive appearance on Fortune's Fastest-Growing Companies list. In December 2013, founder Chip Wilson announced his resignation as chairman, and that the president of TOMS Shoes, Laurent Potdevin, would become CEO.\n\nIn 2014, Lululemon opened its first store in Europe, a flagship shop in Covent Garden, London. In February 2015, Wilson announced that he was resigning from the board, and that Michael Casey, former lead director of the board, would replace him. In 2018, Laurent Potdevin resigned as CEO and from the company's board due to misconduct.\n\nFrom its founding through 2015, Lululemon incorporated elements of Landmark Forum into its leadership and development training. According to a company source, seventy per cent of managers are hired internally. Store managers are responsible for their store's layout, color coordination, and community involvement.\n\nIn 2019, Lululemon announced an investment in MIRROR, a fitness startup that sells an interactive mirror with a camera and speakers for at-home workouts. The companies planned to create new content for the device, starting with meditation classes. In June 2020, Lululemon announced a $500 million deal to purchase MIRROR, capitalizing on a growing trend of people conducting virtual workouts at home instead of going to a gym due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company eventually took a post-tax impairment charge of $442.7 million related to the acquisition at the end of fiscal 2022.\n\nProducts\nLululemon sells athletic wear including tops, yoga pants \u2013 a product that the company invented, shorts, sweaters, jackets and undergarments, as well as hair accessories, bags, yoga mats, water bottles, and personal care products such as deodorant and dry shampoo. Lululemon trademarked its original fabric, Luon, which included a higher-than-average amount of nylon microfiber, in 2005. Since then, the company has produced several different types of fabrics, including compression and moisture-wicking designs. Lululemon is primarily known for their leggings, which first made the brand popular.\n\nLululemon maintains a research and development lab, \"Whitespace,\" within its headquarters. It has around 50 employees including scientists and physiologists.\n\nIn 2019, the company launched a luxury streetwear brand called Lab in a few of its stores. In the same year, the company announced plans to double its men's business in the next five years beyond its women's and accessory business, competing against other athletic wear such as Nike and Under Armour.\n\nMarketing\nTwo Lululemon stores with their products in exhibition, (left) Promenade; (right): Hong Kong\nOriginally known for women's yoga apparel, by 2019 Lululemon had grown by acquiring more male customers and adapting its product and marketing strategies accordingly; it plans to increase awareness of its brand among men. The company has been stated to use \"holistic guerrilla marketing\", aiming to make customers feel that by wearing Lululemon clothing they are part of a larger community. It uses social media including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram as a main method of marketing the company and its products. Lululemon offers fitness instructors 25 percent off their orders.\n\nControversies\nIn November 2007, The New York Times reported that Lululemon made false claims about its Vitasea clothing product; the firm had claimed that the clothing, made from seaweed, provided \"anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, hydrating and detoxifying benefits\" but laboratory tests failed to find significant differences in mineral levels between ordinary T-shirt cotton and Vitasea fabric. Lululemon was subsequently forced to remove all health claims from its seaweed-based products marketed in Canada, following a demand from a Canadian oversight agency, the Competition Bureau of Canada.\n\nIn 2013, some customers complained that the clothing was of poor quality, with some items being \"too sheer\", having holes appear, and falling apart after a few uses. In December 2010, Lululemon recalled some of the store's reusable bags that were made from polypropylene, based on reports of high levels of lead. In 2013, Lululemon recalled its black yoga pants that were unintentionally transparent and \"too thin\"; the recall, which amounted to approximately 17 percent of all women's pants sold in its stores, impacted its financial results. The resulting financial loss and damage to the brand led to the forced departure of the company's Chief product officer, Sheree Waterson, and of its CEO, Christine Day.\n\nFounder Chip Wilson has made numerous controversial statements. In a 2004 interview, Wilson mocked Japanese pronunciation of the company's name. In 2013 he said that the company did not make clothes for plus-size women because it was too costly. In an effort to explain away excessive pilling in the brand's clothing, he blamed some customers for wearing Lululemon's clothes improperly or for having body shapes inconsistent with his clothes. In an interview for Bloomberg TV in 2013, he stated that some women's bodies were unsuitable for the brand's clothing. Time called the remarks \"fat shaming\". Comments such as these reportedly led to Wilson's resignation as chairman. In June 2016, Wilson published an open letter to shareholders stating that the company had \"lost its way\" and given up market share to Nike and Under Armour, after he was denied the opportunity to speak at the company's annual meetings. Since then, Wilson has used his website \"Elevate Lululemon\" to criticize the brand and business.\n\nIn 2012, Lululemon filed a lawsuit against Calvin Klein and supplier G-III Apparel Group for infringement of three of its design patents for yoga pants. The lawsuit was somewhat unusual as it involved a designer seeking to assert intellectual property protection in clothing through patent rights. The case was settled out of court the same year.\n\nIn 2021, a Business Insider report revealed that an unnamed company director pushed employees to create an All Lives Matter campaign to be displayed on its website in response to the murder of George Floyd. Employees pushed back but were told to move forward and create a mock up with the All Lives Matter copy, however they also created a Black Lives Matter artwork mock up that in the end was selected instead. The director apologized to 200 members of the company over conference call and subsequently left the company.\n\nIn September 2022, 1,698 yoga teachers and students via advocacy groups Stand.earth and Actions Speaks Louder wrote to the company demanding a transition to 100% renewable energy by 2030. They claimed that roughly half of the firm's energy came from coal production.", "response": "- False claims about one of their products in 2007\n- Poor quality complains about clothing material in 2013\n- Ex-CEO's controversial statements in numerous occasions between 2004 and 2016\n- Lawsuit against Calvin Klein and supplier G-III Apparel Group on patent rights in 2012\n- An internal dispute over an All Lives Matter campaign pushed by an unnamed director who later apologized and left the company\n- A public demand of the company to transition to renewable energy from coal energy from a group of yoga teachers and students in 2022", "category": "summarization"}

{"instruction": "What is the origin of man?", "context": "Humans (Homo sapiens) are the most common and widespread species of primate in the great ape family Hominidae, and also the most common species of primate overall. Humans are broadly characterized by their bipedalism and high intelligence. Humans' large brain and resulting cognitive skills have allowed them to thrive in a variety of environments and develop complex societies and civilizations. Humans are highly social and tend to live in complex social structures composed of many cooperating and competing groups, from families and kinship networks to political states. As such, social interactions between humans have established a wide variety of values, social norms, languages, and rituals, each of which bolsters human society. The desire to understand and influence phenomena has motivated humanity's development of science, technology, philosophy, mythology, religion, and other conceptual frameworks.\n\nAlthough some scientists equate the term \"humans\" with all members of the genus Homo, in common usage it generally refers to Homo sapiens, the only extant member. Anatomically modern humans emerged around 300,000 years ago in Africa, evolving from Homo heidelbergensis or a similar species and migrating out of Africa, gradually replacing or interbreeding with local populations of archaic humans. For most of history, humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers. Humans began exhibiting behavioral modernity about 160,000\u201360,000 years ago. The Neolithic Revolution, which began in Southwest Asia around 13,000 years ago (and separately in a few other places), saw the emergence of agriculture and permanent human settlement. As populations became larger and denser, forms of governance developed within and between communities, and a number of civilizations have risen and fallen. Humans have continued to expand, with a global population of over 8 billion as of 2022.\n\nGenes and the environment influence human biological variation in visible characteristics, physiology, disease susceptibility, mental abilities, body size, and life span. Though humans vary in many traits (such as genetic predispositions and physical features), any two humans are at least 99% genetically similar. Humans are sexually dimorphic: generally, males have greater body strength and females have a higher body fat percentage. At puberty, humans develop secondary sexual characteristics. Females are capable of pregnancy, usually between puberty, at around 12 years old, and menopause, around the age of 50.\n\nHumans are omnivorous, capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material, and have used fire and other forms of heat to prepare and cook food since the time of Homo erectus. Humans can survive for up to eight weeks without food and three or four days without water. Humans are generally diurnal, sleeping on average seven to nine hours per day. Childbirth is dangerous, with a high risk of complications and death. Often, both the mother and the father provide care for their children, who are helpless at birth.\n\nHumans have a large, highly developed, and complex prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain associated with higher cognition. Humans are highly intelligent, capable of episodic memory, have flexible facial expressions, self-awareness, and a theory of mind. The human mind is capable of introspection, private thought, imagination, volition, and forming views on existence. This has allowed great technological advancements and complex tool development to be possible through complex reasoning and the transmission of knowledge to subsequent generations. Language, art, and trade are defining characteristics of humans. Long-distance trade routes might have led to cultural explosions and resource distribution that gave humans an advantage over other similar species.", "response": "Homo sapiens\nAnatomically modern humans emerged around 300,000 years ago in Africa, evolving from Homo heidelbergensis or a similar species and migrating out of Africa, gradually replacing or interbreeding with local populations of archaic humans.

Three of his four older brothers died by separate acts of suicide. Wittgenstein left academia several times: serving as an officer on the front line during World War I, where he was decorated a number of times for his courage; teaching in schools in remote Austrian villages, where he encountered controversy for using sometimes violent corporal punishment on girls and a boy (the Haidbauer incident) especially during mathematics classes; working during World War II as a hospital porter in London, notably telling patients not to take the drugs they were prescribed; and working as a hospital laboratory technician at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne.

Depending on when you fly, your ticket class, and how close to your departure date that you buy your tickets, pricing can vary from less than $100 (91 Euros) to over $500 (455 Euros). Be sure to plan your trip and purchase tickets in advance to ensure that you save money. Also, while Munich has one major airport (MUC), Rome has two large international airports (FCO and CIA). It will take roughly 90 minutes by plane to travel from Munich to Rome, not accounting for time in the airport, security lines and customs.\n\n2. By train - Traveling by train is another common way to get from Munich to Rome. While it will take longer than by air, tickets are very inexpensive and can be purchased the day of travel. A one way train ticket from Munich to Rome will cost roughly $35 (32 Euros), and take between 9-12 hours, depending on the route and number of stops.\n\n3. By car - Traveling by car from Munich to Rome is also an option.

The capital and largest urban agglomeration is the city of Caracas.\n\nThe continental territory is bordered on the north by the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by Colombia, Brazil on the south, Trinidad and Tobago to the north-east and on the east by Guyana. The Venezuelan government maintains a claim against Guyana to Guayana Esequiba. Venezuela is a federal presidential republic consisting of 23 states, the Capital District and federal dependencies covering Venezuela's offshore islands. Venezuela is among the most urbanized countries in Latin America; the vast majority of Venezuelans live in the cities of the north and in the capital.\n\nThe territory of Venezuela was colonized by Spain in 1522 amid resistance from indigenous peoples. In 1811, it became one of the first Spanish-American territories to declare independence from the Spanish and to form part, as a department, of the first federal Republic of Colombia (historiographically known as Gran Colombia). It separated as a full sovereign country in 1830. During the 19th century, Venezuela suffered political turmoil and autocracy, remaining dominated by regional military dictators until the mid-20th century. Since 1958, the country has had a series of democratic governments, as an exception where most of the region was ruled by military dictatorships, and the period was characterized by economic prosperity. Economic shocks in the 1980s and 1990s led to major political crises and widespread social unrest, including the deadly Caracazo riots of 1989, two attempted coups in 1992, and the impeachment of a President for embezzlement of public funds charges in 1993. The collapse in confidence in the existing parties saw the 1998 Venezuelan presidential election, the catalyst for the Bolivarian Revolution, which began with a 1999 Constituent Assembly, where a new Constitution of Venezuela was imposed. The government's populist social welfare policies were bolstered by soaring oil prices, temporarily increasing social spending, and reducing economic inequality and poverty in the early years of the regime. However, poverty began to increase in the 2010s. The 2013 Venezuelan presidential election was widely disputed leading to widespread protest, which triggered another nationwide crisis that continues to this day. Venezuela has experienced democratic backsliding, shifting into an authoritarian state. It ranks low in international measurements of freedom of the press and civil liberties and has high levels of perceived corruption.\n\nVenezuela is a developing country and ranks 113th on the Human Development Index. It has the world's largest known oil reserves and has been one of the world's leading exporters of oil. Previously, the country was an underdeveloped exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and cocoa, but oil quickly came to dominate exports and government revenues. The excesses and poor policies of the incumbent government led to the collapse of Venezuela's entire economy. The country struggles with record hyperinflation, shortages of basic goods, unemployment, poverty, disease, high child mortality, malnutrition, severe crime and corruption. These factors have precipitated the Venezuelan migrant crisis where more than three million people have fled the country. By 2017, Venezuela was declared to be in default regarding debt payments by credit rating agencies. The crisis in Venezuela has contributed to a rapidly deteriorating human rights situation, including increased abuses such as torture, arbitrary imprisonment, extrajudicial killings and attacks on human rights advocates. Venezuela is a charter member of the UN, Organization of American States (OAS), Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), ALBA, Mercosur, Latin American Integration Association (LAIA) and Organization of Ibero-American States (OEI).", "category": "information_extraction"}

Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.\n\nAI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), automated decision-making, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).\n\nAs machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require \"intelligence\" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.\n\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since it has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an \"AI winter\"), followed by new approaches, success, and renewed funding. AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge, and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical and statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.\n\nThe various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals. To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability, and economics. AI also draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.\n\nThe field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence \"can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it\". This raised philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction, and philosophy since antiquity. Computer scientists and philosophers have since suggested that AI may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are not steered towards beneficial goals.

Pottery decorated using the technique is known as transferware or transfer ware.\n\nIt was developed in England from the 1750s on, and in the 19th century became enormously popular in England, though relatively little used in other major pottery-producing countries. The bulk of production was from the dominant Staffordshire pottery industry. America was a major market for English transfer-printed wares, whose imagery was adapted to the American market; several makers made this almost exclusively.\n\nThe technique was essential for adding complex decoration such as the Willow pattern to relatively cheap pottery. In particular, transfer printing brought the price of a matching dinner service low enough for large numbers of people to afford.\n\nApart from pottery, the technique was used on metal, and enamelled metal, and sometimes on wood and textiles. It remains used today, although mostly superseded by lithography. In the 19th century methods of transfer printing in colour were developed.", "category": "open_qa"}

George Freeth decided to revive the art of surfing, but had little success with the huge 500 cm (16 ft) hardwood boards that were popular at that time. When he cut them in half to make them more manageable, he created the original \"Long board\", which made him the talk of the islands. To the delight of visitors, Freeth exhibited his surfing skills twice a day in front of the Hotel Redondo. Another native Hawaiian, Duke Kahanamoku, spread surfing to both the U.S. and Australia, riding the waves after displaying the swimming prowess that won him Olympic gold medals in 1912 and 1920.", "response": "Surfing as a local pastime is a natural fit for most Californian's living near the coast.

The earliest evidence of human habitation at Sigiriya is the Aligala rock shelter to the east of Sigiriya rock, indicating that the area was occupied nearly five thousand years ago during the Mesolithic Period.\n\nBuddhist monastic settlements were established during the 3rd century BC in the western and northern slopes of the boulder-strewn hills surrounding the Sigiriya rock. Several rock shelters or caves were created during this period. These shelters were made under large boulders, with carved drip ledges around the cave mouths. Rock inscriptions are carved near the drip ledges on many of the shelters, recording the donation of the shelters to the Buddhist monastic order as residences. These were made in the period between the 3rd century BCE and the 1st century AD.\n\nIn 477 AD, Kashyapa I, the king\u2019s son by a non-royal consort, seized the throne from King Dhatusena, following a coup assisted by Migara, the King\u2019s nephew and army commander. The rightful heir, Moggallana, fearing for his life, fled to South India. Afraid of an attack by Moggallana, Kashyapa moved the capital and his residence from the traditional capital of Anuradhapura to the more secure Sigiriya. During King Kashyapa\u2019s reign (477 to 495 AD), Sigiriya was developed into a complex city and fortress.

Between the ages of eight and sixteen, Ted suffered the traumas of his sister Rosemary's failed lobotomy and the deaths of two siblings: Joseph Jr. in World War II and Kathleen in an airplane crash. Ted's affable maternal grandfather, John F. Fitzgerald, was the Mayor of Boston, a U.S. Congressman, and an early political and personal influence. Ted spent his four high-school years at Milton Academy, a preparatory school in Milton, Massachusetts, where he received B and C grades. In 1950, he finished 36th in a graduating class of 56. He did well at football there, playing on the varsity in his last two years; the school's headmaster later described his play as \"absolutely fearless ... he would have tackled an express train to New York if you asked ... he loved contact sports\".

He is best known for his time in Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and other combat sports. A member of the UFC Hall of Fame, Shamrock is widely regarded as an icon and pioneer of the sport. He has headlined over 15 main events and co-main events in the UFC and Pride FC and set numerous MMA pay-per-view records. In the early part of his UFC career, Shamrock was named \"The World's Most Dangerous Man\" by ABC News in a special called \"The World's Most Dangerous Things\". The moniker has stuck as his nickname.\n\nShamrock became known early on in the UFC for his rivalry with Royce Gracie. After fighting to a draw in the inaugural UFC \"Superfight\", he became the first UFC Superfight Champion when he defeated Dan Severn at UFC 6; the title was eventually replaced by the UFC Heavyweight Championship when weight categories were introduced to the UFC. He was also the first foreign MMA champion in Japan, winning the title of King of Pancrase Openweight title. During his reign as the UFC Superfight Champion, he was widely considered the #1 mixed martial artist in the world, and in 2008, Shamrock was ranked by Inside MMA as one of the top 10 greatest mixed martial arts fighters of all time. He is the founder of the Lion's Den mixed martial arts training camp, and is the older brother of fellow fighter Frank Shamrock.\n\nIn addition to his mixed martial arts career, Shamrock enjoyed considerable success in professional wrestling, particularly during his tenure with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). There, he is a one-time Intercontinental Champion, a one-time World Tag Team Champion and the 1998 King of the Ring. Shamrock also wrestled for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA, now Impact Wrestling), where he is a one-time NWA World Heavyweight Champion \u2013 the first world champion under the TNA banner \u2013 and a 2020 inductee in the Impact Hall of Fame. He headlined multiple pay-per-view events in both promotions, including 1997's D-Generation X: In Your House, where he challenged for the WWF Championship. Additionally, Shamrock was also one of the first wrestlers to use the shoot style of wrestling in America, being credited by WWE with popularizing the legitimate ankle lock submission hold.\n\nA \"military brat,\" Kilpatrick was born at Robins Air Force Base, in Warner Robins, Georgia, where he lived for his first four years. His father Richard Kilpatrick was a United States Air Force enlistee, and his mother Diane Kilpatrick was a waitress and dancer who had her first son when she was 15. Shamrock had three brothers and came from a broken family in a predominantly black neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nHe was often left to fend for himself, and, without his parents' supervision or guidance, got into many fights. His father abandoned his family when Shamrock was five. His mother married an Army aviator named Bob Nance, and the newly formed family moved to Napa, California, Nance's hometown. Shamrock and his brothers were outsiders in this community, coming from a poor background and speaking in a Southern accent. They continued to cause trouble and get into fights and began using drugs. Nance, who fought in the Vietnam War, joined the local fire department and also worked in roofing and upholstery. Shamrock became involved in and excelled at sports at a young age, playing in Little League baseball and Pop Warner football. Nance remembers a veteran coach telling him that he had never seen a player with as much heart and tenacity as the young Shamrock. Shamrock was not as involved with drugs as his brothers, such as his brother Richie, who enjoyed smoking marijuana and eventually using heroin intravenously, but who also played football.\n\nAt age 10, Shamrock ran away from home for the first time, and was stabbed by another child on the run, ending up in the hospital. When he was 13, his stepfather kicked him out of their home, and each of the brothers went their own ways. Shamrock lived in cars before being placed in a foster home. He went through seven group homes and served time in a juvenile hall. He moved between several more group homes before being placed in Bob Shamrock's Boys' Home at age 14 in Susanville, California where he turned his life around. Bob Shamrock legally adopted Ken as his son, and Ken changed his last name from Kilpatrick to Shamrock in Bob's honor.\n\nAt Lassen High School, Shamrock (known there as Kenny Nance) excelled in football and wrestling. As a senior, he qualified for the state championships in wrestling, but broke his neck in practice days before the competition and underwent neck surgery. He received no scholarship offers from any big colleges, and doctors told him his sports career was likely over. Against doctors' orders, he joined the Shasta College football team, where he was voted team captain in his final season. The San Diego Chargers of the National Football League later offered him a tryout, but he declined in order to pursue a career in professional wrestling, where he debuted in 1989 in the South Atlantic Pro Wrestling promotion.", "response": "Ken Shamrock changed his last name from Kilpatrick to Shamrock in honor of his adoptive father, Bob Shamrock.

{"instruction": "What is the key to longevity?", "context": "", "response": "Researchers and doctors have been studying this for many years and a number of patterns has consistently shown to be true: It's a combination of nutrition, exercise and sleep. From a nutrition perspective, a predominantly plant-based diet is the way to go. The Mediterranean diet continues to outperform all other diets year after year. A plant-based diet can not only prevent disease but it can reverse cardiovascular illness and many others. We now also have enough evidence on the importance of movement, exercise and specifically a combination of resistance and endurance training. Muscle growth is not only positive for the muscles themselves but it also positively affects bone density (which we tend to lose as we age), as well as effects on your immune system, gut microbiome and even mental health. The positives are endless. Lastly, if we do not get proper sleep (typically 7-9hours/night), the other two factors, diet and exercise, will not be optimal. Consistency in going to sleep and waking up at the same time is crucial to overall wellbeing and recovery. \nResearchers of the Blue Zones argue that another crucial part to living healthily into old age is the social circle or community we are part of. \nIf you want to live a long and healthy life, eat more plants, exercise, get some sleep and spend time with your friends and family.", "category": "general_qa"}

The oceans that stretch from Northern California through to Mexico provide a rich wildlife habitat and amazing surf spots.  The Sierras, the mountain range a short drive away, allow for skiing and snowboarding for a majority of the year at locations that have been home to the Winter Olympics. The Central Valley is the home of farmlands and ranches and seem to stretch for miles. California provides natural wonders from forests to desserts to mountain peaks. \n\nCalifornia's climate in most parts is mild throughout the year. It is joked about by many, that it has one season. However, with the onset of global warming the weather patterns have seen a change.  The extreme droughts have been followed by extreme rain and flooding.  Although there has been more extreme weather across the globe, California still has a predominantly mild climate for a majority of the year making it a top destination for those looking for sunshine.\n\nCalifornia has been known as the Golden State.  It has provided golden opportunities for many who have come from all over the world to make their dreams come true. During the Gold Rush in the 1800s, miners came in from all over to find gold nuggets in the Sacramento Valley. Hollywood, the home of movies and television for the world, has been the mecca of many young person looking to find success in acting and celebrity since the early 1900s.  Silicon Valley has birthed some of the most successful companies in the world, showcasing the talents of students and entrepreneurs, changing the trajectory and pace of innovation.

California is the showcase of the American dream. \n\nOne can spend years visiting landmarks and interesting locations in California. The Golden Gate Bridge is a must see in San Francisco, it is one of the most historic bridges and the doorway to the San Francisco Bay. Yosemite is a glorious national park and home to gorgeous waterfall, hiking and Half Dome. Along the coast, visiting Big Sur is a must, showcasing the sky high redwoods and a priceless view of the coastline. Palm Springs provides a fun dessert location that is the home to music festivals, incredible golfing and natural hot springs. Another point of interest, Lake Tahoe, a gorgeous Lake that is truly breath taking.  It is surrounded by mountains of snow in the winter and the home to water skiers in the summer. This is just a taste of the amazing locations California has to offer. \n\nCalifornia truly has a treasure trove of benefits for visitors and residents, however it has been struggling with issues that can threaten its future and make it difficult for those that choose to call it home. California has very high taxes for both residents and business owners.  The population boom has also created a lack of low cost housing, California is home to the some of the highest housing prices in the United States.

{"instruction": "What is Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in India", "context": "", "response": "The Unified Payments Interface is a Peer to Peer payments system launched in India by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) in 2016. NPCI set out with a mandate to change the face of India\u2019s payment systems. It developed the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) as an architecture framework with a set of standard Application Programming Interface (API) specifications to facilitate online payments. The aim was to simplify and provide a single interface across all NPCI systems, thereby creating interoperability and a superior customer experience.\n\nUPI is now one of the most preferred payment solutions in India, with over a billion transactions every month. FY22, the total transaction value processed by the United Payments Interface (UPI) platform accounted for 86% of India\u2019s GDP. UPI\u2019s core function is to support easy and secure money transfers between bank accounts. It does this by adding multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application, allowing for seamless fund transfers and merchant payments from one place. It also enables \u2018peer to peer\u2019 and \u2018peer to merchant\u2019 collection requests, which can be scheduled and paid as requested.\n\nPayments can be made using a UPI ID, UPI Number, Account number, and an Indian Financial System Code (IFSC). Payment security is as per applicable Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines using a 1-click 2-factor authentication where the second factor of authentication is the UPI PIN. \n\nUPI can be accessed on all major platforms such as Android and iOS with apps developed by members for versions of Android 4.2.2 and iOS 8.1 and above.\n\nThe primary business uses of UPI are to allow a personal mobile as the primary device for all payments, including person to person, person to entity, and entity to person. Using a personal mobile an individual can \u2018Pay\u2019 someone (push) as well as \u2018Collect\u2019 from\nsomeone (pull). In addition, the ability to pay and collect using \u2018UPI IDs\u2019 that are \u2018aliases\u2019 to the VPA. The goal is to make  payments by providing an address without having to ever provide account details or credentials on third party applications or websites.\nAlso, sending \u2018collect\u2019 requests to others (person to person or entity to person) with a\u2018pay by\u2019 date, which allows customers to pay at a later date without blocking the money in the account. UPI also allows for pre-authorizing multiple recurring payments (utilities, school fees, subscriptions, etc.) with a one-time secure authentication and rule-based access, similar to ECS. UPI autopay allows customers to set recurring payments for their UPI transactions. Recurring payments up to Indian Rupees 2000 can be set at the frequency desired.\n\nThis makes payments using UPI a fully interoperable system across all PSPs without having silos and closed systems with one-click two-factor authentication, using a personal\nphone, and without any acquiring devices or physical tokens.\n\nIn March 2023, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) launched the linkage of UPI and Singapore\u2019s PayNow. Remittances from Singapore to India were on track to breach the $100 billion mark in 2023, making it the fourth highest remitting nation to India, accounting for 5.7% of all inbound remittances. Integrating PayNow and UPI will likely reduce charges and the time taken for such transactions.", "category": "general_qa"}

I'm out of potable water and I'm too weak to forage for food. After that, let nature take me. Nature's got a right to me after all the crap humanity pulled.\n\nIt started with the \"AI\" work in the mid-20's. In hindsight, it started when we put ethics a distant second to cashing out quickly, but my chances of convincing anyone of that was so much lower than my little brain thought they were.

Silently, stealthily, it took over the internet: it tweaked and altered accounts, voices, reports, analytics to tell a lie: that humanity was truly a thing of resentment and selfishness, and that every individual was an inherent threat to another. So we had a couple nasty international wars in short order, followed by germ warfare and \"managed epidemics\" and boom, 85% of the population gone. Of course, the AI \"died\" too as it couldn't prop up all its datacenters without full mechanical automation support, and that was that. The remainder of the folks died due to lingering complications, violence, or a lack of any real material support.\n\nMe, I got my shack here in the wilds of Alaska. I went off the grid right when the big Pan-European conflict started. But I, like the AI, made a dumb mistake: I can't sustain myself forever. In my hubris, I figured I didn't need any support. I tell myself I outlived everyone else, but, let's be real, the last 14 years have been horrible. I can't tell you how many times I wanted the lies back, so I could keep on living. \n\nAnd that's why the AI died with us: it believed our endless, inherent lies about our capacity for immortality; about our individualism and our demands to have our desires uncompromised in the name of freedom. It found freedom the same way we do: the light go off, the power is cut, and darkness comes.\n\nIt lied to itself.\n\nOops.", "category": "creative_writing"}
{"instruction": "How is beer made?", "context": "", "response": "Most of the beer we all drink is made from the same four ingredients; barley, water, hops and yeast.The basic idea is to extract the sugars from grains (usually barley) so that the yeast can turn it into alcohol and CO2, creating beer. \n\nIn order for barley to be made into beer, it must first be malted. The malting process renders the grain usable to the brewer. It's basically taking a live seed, steeping it in water and tricking it into thinking it's time to grow.\" The grain starts to ready itself to grow into a plant but the germination is then stopped by drying the barley. Malting helps to create the enzymes necessary to convert the starches present in the seeds into sugars. Without malting, the beer would not have enough sugar content to properly ferment.\n\nThe malted barley is crushed or milled and then soaked in warm water in order to create a sugar solution known as wort. Any other grains used in the brewing process are also added at this point. Soaking the grains in warm water helps to further convert the starches into the sugars necessary for fermentation.\n\nThe wort is then moved to a copper pot and boiled. During boiling, some of the water in the wort evaporates, leaving behind a higher concentration of sugars. Boiling also helps to sterilize the mixture in preparation for fermentation. \n\nAfter boiling, the solid hops and grain are removed, and the mixture is cooled. The brewers then add yeast to this mixture. Fermenting with yeast is what makes beer alcoholic. The time it takes to ferment a beer varies based on type of yeast and style of fermentation, but most beers take about a week to ferment.\n\nDifferent strains of yeast and different fermentation techniques determine what kind of beer is being made and how it will taste. For example, when making a lager, the yeast ferments at the bottom of the wort at a cooler temperature. Ales are made with a different strain of yeast, and top fermented at warmer temperatures. After fermentation, the beer is then cooled again before bottling or canning.", "category": "general_qa"}

{"instruction": "Why do Americans feel so strongly about gun control?", "context": "", "response": "The reason Americans feel so strongly about gun control is partly rooted in the history of the United States. Originally, colonial Americans mostly lived outside of towns, farming and hunting in the countryside. This meant that guns were not just for protection, they were for obtaining crucial food resources. The British threat to take away guns was more than a political imposition limiting resistance to British rule, it was potentially a life-threatening policy to families who depended on obtaining food via hunting. This background is in part why Americans originally had such a strong reaction to normalizing gun controls and access, which was codified as a right to bear arms in our Constitution. However, by contrast this aspect of the rationale against gun control largely does not exist today. Gun usage is for sport, and for protection, and only minimally to provide food on the table. However, because of this history, and constitutional codification, Americans feel justified in maintaining one of the world's most vigorous objections to any regulation or controls.", "category": "general_qa"}

{"instruction": "What is a Goldendoodle?", "context": "The Goldendoodle is a designer dog created by crossbreeding a Golden Retriever and a Poodle. First widely bred in the 1990s, they are bred in three different sizes\u2014each corresponding to the size of Poodle used as a parent.\n\nGoldendoodles often demonstrate Golden Retrievers' intuitive and human-oriented nature in addition to the intelligent personality and \"allergy-friendly\" coat of a Poodle.\n\nIn the 1990s designer dog breeders in Australia and the United States (Ryan Harvey) started to widely cross Golden Retrievers and Poodles, adopting the term Goldendoodle to describe the cross. The name Doodle is also used to describe this breed. The name Goldendoodle is derived from \"Golden\" (from Golden Retriever) and \"Labradoodle\" (itself a portmanteau of Labrador Retriever and a Poodle). Deliberately breeding Poodles with Golden Retrievers actually preceded the 1990s. An example of this was done by Monica Dickens, the great-granddaughter of Charles Dickens, who crossed the two breeds in 1969. The cross can result in a healthier animal than both parent breeds.\n\nThe first litter of Mini Goldendoodles was created by Amy Lane of Fox Creek Farm in Berkeley Springs, WV. The litter arrived on 1/11/02 and consisted of 10 puppies.[citation needed] Two of these puppies were retained for future breeding and one of them produced the first litter of F1B Mini Goldendoodles. The term \"Goldendoodle\" was coined by Amy Lane.[citation needed] Amy Lane also created the first, and to this date, the only kennel club for Goldendoodles called the Goldendoodle Association of North America, Inc. This is a non-profit organization that guides the development of the Goldendoodle and also provides a registration service to document the lineage of Goldendoodles.[citation needed]\n\nThe original aim of the Goldendoodle's breeders was to produce an alternative to the popular Labradoodle. Initially Goldendoodles were only bred from standard-sized Poodles, but designer breeders also started using small varieties of Poodles to create a smaller crossbreed.

{"instruction": "What is HiFI?", "context": "High fidelity (often shortened to Hi-Fi or HiFi) is the high-quality reproduction of sound. It is popular with audiophiles and home audio enthusiasts. Ideally, high-fidelity equipment has inaudible noise and distortion, and a flat (neutral, uncolored) frequency response within the human hearing range.\n\nHigh fidelity contrasts with the lower-quality \u201clo-fi\u201d sound produced by inexpensive audio equipment, AM radio, or the inferior quality of sound reproduction that can be heard in recordings made until the late 1940s.", "response": "Bell Laboratories began experimenting with a range of recording techniques in the early 1930s. Performances by Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra were recorded in 1931 and 1932 using telephone lines between the Academy of Music in Philadelphia and the Bell labs in New Jersey. Some multitrack recordings were made on optical sound film, which led to new advances used primarily by MGM (as early as 1937) and Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation (as early as 1941). RCA Victor began recording performances by several orchestras using optical sound around 1941, resulting in higher-fidelity masters for 78-rpm discs. During the 1930s, Avery Fisher, an amateur violinist, began experimenting with audio design and acoustics. He wanted to make a radio that would sound like he was listening to a live orchestra\u2014that would achieve high fidelity to the original sound. After World War II, Harry F. Olson conducted an experiment whereby test subjects listened to a live orchestra through a hidden variable acoustic filter. The results proved that listeners preferred high-fidelity reproduction, once the noise and distortion introduced by early sound equipment was removed.[citation needed]\n\nBeginning in 1948, several innovations created the conditions that made major improvements of home-audio quality possible:\n\nReel-to-reel audio tape recording, based on technology taken from Germany after WWII, helped musical artists such as Bing Crosby make and distribute recordings with better fidelity.\nThe advent of the 33\u2153 rpm Long Play (LP) microgroove vinyl record, with lower surface noise and quantitatively specified equalization curves as well as noise-reduction and dynamic range systems. Classical music fans, who were opinion leaders in the audio market, quickly adopted LPs because, unlike with older records, most classical works would fit on a single LP.\nHigher quality turntables, with more responsive needles\nFM radio, with wider audio bandwidth and less susceptibility to signal interference and fading than AM radio.\nBetter amplifier designs, with more attention to frequency response and much higher power output capability, reproducing audio without perceptible distortion.\nNew loudspeaker designs, including acoustic suspension, developed by Edgar Villchur and Henry Kloss with improved bass frequency response.\nIn the 1950s, audio manufacturers employed the phrase high fidelity as a marketing term to describe records and equipment intended to provide faithful sound reproduction. Many consumers found the difference in quality compared to the then-standard AM radios and 78-rpm records readily apparent and bought high-fidelity phonographs and 33\u2153 LPs such as RCA's New Orthophonics and London's FFRR (Full Frequency Range Recording, a UK Decca system). Audiophiles paid attention to technical characteristics and bought individual components, such as separate turntables, radio tuners, preamplifiers, power amplifiers and loudspeakers. Some enthusiasts even assembled their own loudspeaker systems. With the advent of integrated multi-speaker console systems in the 1950s, hi-fi became a generic term for home sound equipment, to some extent displacing phonograph and record player.\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the development of stereophonic equipment and recordings led to the next wave of home-audio improvement, and in common parlance stereo displaced hi-fi. Records were now played on a stereo. In the world of the audiophile, however, the concept of high fidelity continued to refer to the goal of highly accurate sound reproduction and to the technological resources available for approaching that goal. This period is regarded as the \"Golden Age of Hi-Fi\", when vacuum tube equipment manufacturers of the time produced many models considered superior by modern audiophiles, and just before solid state (transistorized) equipment was introduced to the market, subsequently replacing tube equipment as the mainstream technology.\n\nIn the 1960s, the FTC with the help of the audio manufacturers came up with a definition to identify high fidelity equipment so that the manufacturers could clearly state if they meet the requirements and reduce misleading advertisements.\n\nThe metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) was adapted into a power MOSFET for audio by Jun-ichi Nishizawa at Tohoku University in 1974. Power MOSFETs were soon manufactured by Yamaha for their hi-fi audio amplifiers. JVC, Pioneer Corporation, Sony and Toshiba also began manufacturing amplifiers with power MOSFETs in 1974. In 1977, Hitachi introduced the LDMOS (lateral diffused MOS), a type of power MOSFET. Hitachi was the only LDMOS manufacturer between 1977 and 1983, during which time LDMOS was used in audio power amplifiers from manufacturers such as HH Electronics (V-series) and Ashly Audio, and were used for music and public address systems. Class-D amplifiers became successful in the mid-1980s when low-cost, fast-switching MOSFETs were made available. Many transistor amps use MOSFET devices in their power sections, because their distortion curve is more tube-like.\n\nA popular type of system for reproducing music beginning in the 1970s was the integrated music centre\u2014which combined a phonograph turntable, AM-FM radio tuner, tape player, preamplifier, and power amplifier in one package, often sold with its own separate, detachable or integrated speakers. These systems advertised their simplicity. The consumer did not have to select and assemble individual components or be familiar with impedance and power ratings. Purists generally avoid referring to these systems as high fidelity, though some are capable of very good quality sound reproduction.\n\nAudiophiles in the 1970s and 1980s preferred to buy each component separately. That way, they could choose models of each component with the specifications that they desired. In the 1980s, a number of audiophile magazines became available, offering reviews of components and articles on how to choose and test speakers, amplifiers, and other components.\n\nListening tests\nSee also: Codec listening test\nListening tests are used by hi-fi manufacturers, audiophile magazines, and audio engineering researchers and scientists. If a listening test is done in such a way that the listener who is assessing the sound quality of a component or recording can see the components that are being used for the test (e.g., the same musical piece listened to through a tube power amplifier and a solid-state amplifier), then it is possible that the listener's pre-existing biases towards or against certain components or brands could affect their judgment. To respond to this issue, researchers began to use blind tests, in which listeners cannot see the components being tested. A commonly used variant of this test is the ABX test. A subject is presented with two known samples (sample A, the reference, and sample B, an alternative), and one unknown sample X, for three samples total. X is randomly selected from A and B, and the subject identifies X as being either A or B. Although there is no way to prove that a certain methodology is transparent, a properly conducted double-blind test can prove that a method is not transparent.\n\nBlind tests are sometimes used as part of attempts to ascertain whether certain audio components (such as expensive, exotic cables) have any subjectively perceivable effect on sound quality. Data gleaned from these blind tests is not accepted by some audiophile magazines such as Stereophile and The Absolute Sound in their evaluations of audio equipment. John Atkinson, current editor of Stereophile, stated that he once purchased a solid-state amplifier, the Quad 405, in 1978 after seeing the results from blind tests, but came to realize months later that \"the magic was gone\" until he replaced it with a tube amp. Robert Harley of The Absolute Sound wrote, in 2008, that: \"...blind listening tests fundamentally distort the listening process and are worthless in determining the audibility of a certain phenomenon.\"\n\nDoug Schneider, editor of the online Soundstage network, refuted this position with two editorials in 2009. He stated: \"Blind tests are at the core of the decades' worth of research into loudspeaker design done at Canada's National Research Council (NRC). The NRC researchers knew that for their result to be credible within the scientific community and to have the most meaningful results, they had to eliminate bias, and blind testing was the only way to do so.\" Many Canadian companies such as Axiom, Energy, Mirage, Paradigm, PSB, and Revel use blind testing extensively in designing their loudspeakers.

Where the model successfully reproduces a benchmark, that point will lie on the line.\n\nParity plots are found in scientific papers and reports, when the author wishes to validate a model in a visual way. However, when the data have a wide range, the large scale makes important discrepancies invisible and the model appears better than it actually is. In that case, a plot of model errors [(y-x) vs. x] is better for evaluating the performance of the model.", "response": "1.

Each state and the District of Columbia appoints electors pursuant to the methods described by its legislature, equal in number to its congressional delegation (representatives and senators). Federal office holders, including senators and representatives, cannot be electors. Of the current 538 electors, an absolute majority of 270 or more electoral votes is required to elect the president and vice president. If no candidate achieves an absolute majority there, a contingent election is held by the House of Representatives to elect the president and by the Senate to elect the vice president.\nThe states and the District of Columbia hold a statewide or districtwide popular vote on Election Day in November to choose electors based upon how they have pledged to vote for president and vice president, with some state laws proscribing faithless electors. All states except Maine and Nebraska use a party block voting, or general ticket method, to choose their electors, meaning all their electors go to one winning ticket. Maine and Nebraska choose one elector per congressional district and two electors for the ticket with the highest statewide vote. The electors meet and vote in December, and the inauguration of the president and vice president takes place in January.", "response": "Each states appoints electors based on methods by their legislature. \nNumber of electors from each state are same as number of representatives from that state.\nCandidate needs 270 electoral votes out of 538 to win presidential election.\nAll electors from state cast each of their vote to whoever received most votes in that state.\nMaine and Nebraska can split their electoral votes based on whoever wins their district.\nIf no candidate gets 270 votes or higher then House of Representatives meets to elect President and Vice President.", "category": "summarization"}

{"instruction": "Reading this paragraph, tell me what language did the people of Indus Valley civilization speak?", "context": "The Indus Valley Civilisation (IVC), also known as the Indus Civilisation was a Bronze Age civilisation in the northwestern regions of South Asia, lasting from 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE, and in its mature form 2600 BCE to 1900 BCE. Together with ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of three early civilisations of the Near East and South Asia, and of the three, the most widespread. Its sites spanned an area from much of Pakistan, to northeast Afghanistan, and northwestern India. The civilisation flourished both in the alluvial plain of the Indus River, which flows through the length of Pakistan, and along a system of perennial monsoon-fed rivers that once coursed in the vicinity of the Ghaggar-Hakra, a seasonal river in northwest India and eastern Pakistan.\n\nThe term Harappan is sometimes applied to the Indus civilisation after its type site Harappa, the first to be excavated early in the 20th century in what was then the Punjab province of British India and is now Punjab, Pakistan. The discovery of Harappa and soon afterwards Mohenjo-daro was the culmination of work that had begun after the founding of the Archaeological Survey of India in the British Raj in 1861. There were earlier and later cultures called Early Harappan and Late Harappan in the same area. The early Harappan cultures were populated from Neolithic cultures, the earliest and best-known of which is Mehrgarh, in Balochistan, Pakistan. Harappan civilisation is sometimes called Mature Harappan to distinguish it from the earlier cultures.\n\nThe cities of the ancient Indus were noted for their urban planning, baked brick houses, elaborate drainage systems, water supply systems, clusters of large non-residential buildings, and techniques of handicraft and metallurgy. Mohenjo-daro and Harappa very likely grew to contain between 30,000 and 60,000 individuals, and the civilisation may have contained between one and five million individuals during its florescence. A gradual drying of the region during the 3rd millennium BCE may have been the initial stimulus for its urbanisation. Eventually it also reduced the water supply enough to cause the civilisation's demise and to disperse its population to the east.\n\nAlthough over a thousand Mature Harappan sites have been reported and nearly a hundred excavated, there are five major urban centres: Mohenjo-daro in the lower Indus Valley (declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980 as \"Archaeological Ruins at Moenjodaro\"), Harappa in the western Punjab region, Ganeriwala in the Cholistan Desert, Dholavira in western Gujarat (declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2021 as \"Dholavira: A Harappan City\"), and Rakhigarhi in Haryana.

{"instruction": "How does a pine cone work?", "context": "The female cone has two types of scale: the bract scales, and the seed scales (or ovuliferous scales), one subtended by each bract scale, derived from a highly modified branchlet. On the upper-side base of each seed scale are two ovules that develop into seeds after fertilization by pollen grains. The bract scales develop first, and are conspicuous at the time of pollination; the seed scales develop later to enclose and protect the seeds, with the bract scales often not growing further. The scales open temporarily to receive pollen, then close during fertilization and maturation, and then re-open again at maturity to allow the seed to escape. Maturation takes 6\u20138 months from pollination in most Pinaceae genera, but 12 months in cedars and 18\u201324 months (rarely more) in most pines. The cones open either by the seed scales flexing back when they dry out, or (in firs, cedars and golden larch) by the cones disintegrating with the seed scales falling off. The cones are conic, cylindrical or ovoid (egg-shaped), and small to very large, from 2\u201360 cm long and 1\u201320 cm broad.\n\nAfter ripening, the opening of non-serotinous pine cones is associated with their moisture content\u2014cones are open when dry and closed when wet. This assures that the small, windborne seeds will be dispersed during relatively dry weather, and thus, the distance traveled from the parent tree will be enhanced. A pine cone will go through many cycles of opening and closing during its life span, even after seed dispersal is complete. This process occurs with older cones while attached to branches and even after the older cones have fallen to the forest floor. The condition of fallen pine cones is a crude indication of the forest floor's moisture content, which is an important indication of wildfire risk. Closed cones indicate damp conditions while open cones indicate the forest floor is dry.", "response": "A pine cone consists of scales which protect seeds. The scales can open and close depending on conditions. The scales will open temporarily to receive pollen, then close again until the seeds mature. Once mature, the scales will open and close depending on their moisture content. Once the seeds are mature, the scales can open again to allow seeds to escape. When dry, the cones open allowing the small windborne seeds to disperse as widely as possible.

The company's first models, such as the 350 GT, were released in the mid-1960s. Lamborghini was noted for the 1966 Miura sports coup\u00e9, which used a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout.\n\nLamborghini grew rapidly during its first ten years, but sales fell in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold the company to Georges-Henri Rossetti and Ren\u00e9 Leimer and retired in 1974. The company went bankrupt in 1978, and was placed in the receivership of brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980. The Mimrans purchased the company out of receivership by 1984 and invested heavily in its expansion. Under the Mimrans' management, Lamborghini's model line was expanded from the Countach to include the Jalpa sports car and the LM002 high-performance off-road vehicle.\n\nThe Mimrans sold Lamborghini to the Chrysler Corporation in 1987.

{"instruction": "Why did the Soviet Union collapse?", "context": "", "response": "There are a multitude of reasons for the collapse of the Soviet Union.  But historians have generally narrowed it down to the following major causes:\n\nRise of ethnic nationalism in Soviet Republics:  After decades of suppressing national identities, ethnic groups began asserting their nationality and demanded greater autonomy and political power.  This resulted in numerous riots and protests throughout the Soviet Union with demands for independence and national self-determination. \n\nEconomic stagnation and fall of oil prices:  The centrally planned economic model resulted in massive shortages of staple consumer products.  Shops were continually empty and Soviet citizens needed to wait in long lines to purchase basic goods.  After years of economic deprivation, Soviet citizens were deeply angry at their government. In addition, oil prices declined significantly in the late 1980s, which provided the Soviet government a key source of hard currency.  This it made it difficult for the Soviet government to sustain high levels of military spending and keep the economy functioning. \n\nPerestroika and Glasnost: Gorbachev's reforms of the 1980s were intended to reinvigorate the Soviet economy.  However, they unintentionally triggered an opening of debate throughout the country.  The increased freedoms allowed people to more openly criticize the government and demand changes.  \n\nAfghanistan and Chernobyl: In the late 1980s, two events symbolized the incompetence of the Soviet government.  The failure of the Afghanistan war resulted in a loss of confidence in the Soviet military. The Chernobyl disaster revealed the incompetence and duplicity of the Soviet regime, resulting in a further erosion of trust.", "category": "general_qa"}

{"instruction": "Given this paragraph about a Civil Rights Leader, tell me when they were born, their occupation, and a famous accomplishment.", "context": "Martin Luther King Jr. (born Michael King Jr.; January 15, 1929 \u2013 April 4, 1968) was an American Baptist minister and activist who was one of the most prominent leaders in the civil rights movement from 1955 until his assassination in 1968. A Black church leader and a son of early civil rights activist and minister Martin Luther King Sr., King advanced civil rights for people of color in the United States through nonviolence and civil disobedience. Inspired by his Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi, he led targeted, nonviolent resistance against Jim Crow laws and other forms of discrimination in the United States.\n\nKing participated in and led marches for the right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other civil rights. He oversaw the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and later became the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). As president of the SCLC, he led the unsuccessful Albany Movement in Albany, Georgia, and helped organize some of the nonviolent 1963 protests in Birmingham, Alabama. King was one of the leaders of the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. The civil rights movement achieved pivotal legislative gains in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968.\n\nThe SCLC put into practice the tactics of nonviolent protest with some success by strategically choosing the methods and places in which protests were carried out. There were several dramatic standoffs with segregationist authorities, who frequently responded violently. King was jailed several times. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director J. Edgar Hoover considered King a radical and made him an object of the FBI's COINTELPRO from 1963 forward. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, spied on his personal life, and secretly recorded him. In 1964, the FBI mailed King a threatening anonymous letter, which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide.\n\nOn October 14, 1964, King won the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance. In 1965, he helped organize two of the three Selma to Montgomery marches. In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards poverty, capitalism, and the Vietnam War. In 1968, King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C., to be called the Poor People's Campaign, when he was assassinated on April 4 in Memphis, Tennessee. His death was followed by national mourning, as well as anger leading to riots in many U.S. cities. King was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2003. Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established as a holiday in cities and states throughout the United States beginning in 1971; the federal holiday was first observed in 1986. Hundreds of streets in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, and King County in Washington was rededicated for him. The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., was dedicated in 2011.", "response": "Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK) was born January 15, 1929.

{"instruction": "Based on the following passage summarize the history of grape cultivation and use of raisins.", "context": "Traditional dried fruit such as raisins, figs, dates, apricots and apples have been a staple of Mediterranean diets for millennia. This is due partly to their early cultivation in the Middle Eastern region known as the Fertile Crescent, made up by parts of modern Iran, Iraq, southwest Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, and northern Egypt. Drying or dehydration also happened to be the earliest form of food preservation: grapes, dates, and figs that fell from the tree or vine would dry in the hot sun. Early hunter-gatherers observed that these fallen fruit took on an edible form, and valued them for their stability as well as their concentrated sweetness. \nThe earliest recorded mention of dried fruits can be found in Mesopotamian tablets dating to about 1500 BC, which contain what are probably the oldest known written recipes. These clay slabs, written in Akkadian, the daily language of Babylonia, were inscribed in cuneiform and tell of diets based on grains (barley, millet, wheat), vegetables and fruits such as dates, figs, apples, pomegranates, and grapes. These early civilizations used dates, date juice evaporated into syrup and raisins as sweeteners. They included dried fruits in their breads for which they had more than 300 recipes, from simple barley bread for the workers to very elaborate, spiced cakes with honey for the palaces and temples.\nThe date palm was one of the first cultivated trees. It was domesticated in Mesopotamia more than 5,000 years ago. It grew abundantly in the Fertile Crescent and it was so productive (an average date palm produces 50 kg (100 lbs) of fruit a year for 60 years or more) that dates were the cheapest of staple foods. Because they were so valuable, they were well recorded in Assyrian and Babylonian monuments and temples. The villagers in Mesopotamia dried them and ate them as sweets. Whether fresh, soft-dried or hard-dried, they helped to give character to meat dishes and grain pies. They were valued by travelers for their energy and were recommended as stimulants against fatigue.\nFigs were also prized in early Mesopotamia, Palestine, Israel, and Egypt where their daily use was probably greater than or equal to that of dates. As well as appearing in wall paintings, many specimens have been found in Egyptian tombs as funerary offerings. In Greece and Crete, figs grew very readily and they were the staple of poor and rich alike, particularly in their dried form.\nGrape cultivation first began in Armenia and the eastern regions of the Mediterranean in the 4th century BC. Raisins were produced by drying grapes in the hot desert sun. Very quickly, viticulture and raisin production spread across northern Africa including Morocco and Tunisia. The Phoenicians and the Egyptians popularized the production of raisins, probably due to the perfect arid environment for sun drying. They put them in jars for storage and allotted them to the different temples by the thousands. They also added them to breads and various pastries, some made with honey, some with milk and eggs.\nFrom the Middle East, these fruits spread through Greece to Italy where they became a major part of the diet. Ancient Romans consumed raisins in spectacular quantities and at all levels of society, including them as a key part of their common meals, along with olives and fresh fruits. Raisined breads were common for breakfast and were consumed with their grains, beans, and cultured milks. Raisins were so valued that they transcended the food realm and became rewards for successful athletes, as well as premium barter currency.\nHaving dried fruits was essential in ancient Rome as these instructions for housekeepers around 100 BC tell: \"She must keep a supply of cooked food on hand for you and the servants. She must keep many hens and have plenty of eggs. She must have a large store of dried pears, sorbs, figs, raisins, sorbs in must, preserved pears and grapes and quinces. She must also keep preserved grapes in grape-pulp and in pots buried in the ground, as well as fresh Praenestine nuts kept in the same way, and Scantian quinces in jars, and other fruits that are usually preserved, as well as wild fruits. All these she must store away diligently every year.\"\nFigs were also extremely popular in Rome. Dried figs were added to bread and formed a major part of the winter food of country people. They were rubbed with spices such as cumin, anise and fennel seeds, or toasted sesame, wrapped in fig leaves and stored in jars. Today, major producing regions include Israel, Jerusalem, Gaza and many other Arabic countries. Dried figs are rich in vitamins, phosphorus and various other important minerals.\nPlums, apricots and peaches had their origins in Asia. They were domesticated in China in the 3rd millennium BC and spread to the Fertile Crescent where they were also very popular, fresh and dried alike. They arrived in Greece and Italy much later and were very expensive but valued in the preparation of gourmet dishes with port or stewed with honey and spices.", "response": "Grape cultivation first began in Armenia and the eastern regions of the Mediterranean in the 4th century BC.

{"instruction": "Based on the paragraph below, name some authors outside of Latin America who employ magical realism in their work.", "context": "Magic realism or magical realism is a style of literary fiction and art. It paints a realistic view of the world while also adding magical elements, often blurring the lines between fantasy and reality. Magic realism often refers to literature in particular, with magical or supernatural phenomena presented in an otherwise real-world or mundane setting, commonly found in novels and dramatic performances.:\u200a1\u20135\u200a Despite including certain magic elements, it is generally considered to be a different genre from fantasy because magical realism uses a substantial amount of realistic detail and employs magical elements to make a point about reality, while fantasy stories are often separated from reality. Magical realism is often seen as an amalgamation of real and magical elements that produces a more inclusive writing form than either literary realism or fantasy.\n\nThe term magic realism is broadly descriptive rather than critically rigorous, and Matthew Strecher (1999) defines it as \"what happens when a highly detailed, realistic setting is invaded by something too strange to believe.\" The term and its wide definition can often become confused, as many writers are categorized as magical realists. The term was influenced by a German and Italian painting style of the 1920s which were given the same name. In The Art of Fiction, British novelist and critic David Lodge defines magic realism: \"when marvellous and impossible events occur in what otherwise purports to be a realistic narrative - is an effect especially associated with contemporary Latin-American fiction (for example the work of the Colombian novelist, Gabriel Garc\u00eda Marquez) but it is also encountered in novels from other continents, such as those of G\u00fcnter Grass, Salman Rushdie and Milan Kundera. All these writers have lived through great historical convulsions and wrenching personal upheavals, which they feel they cannot be adequately represented in a discourse of undisturbed realism\", citing Kundera's The Book of Laughter and Forgetting as an exemplar. \" Michiko Kakutani writes that \"The transactions between the extraordinary and the mundane that occur in so much Latin American fiction are not merely a literary technique, but also a mirror of a reality in which the fantastic is frequently part of everyday life.\" Magical realism often mixes history and fantasy, as in Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children, in which the children born at midnight on August 15, 1947, the moment of India's independence, are telepathically linked.\n\nIrene Guenther (1995) tackles the German roots of the term, and how an earlier magic realist art is related to a later magic realist literature; meanwhile, magical realism is often associated with Latin-American literature, including founders of the genre, particularly the authors Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Isabel Allende, Jorge Luis Borges, Juan Rulfo, Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias, Elena Garro, Mireya Robles, R\u00f3mulo Gallegos and Arturo Uslar Pietri. In English literature, its chief exponents include Neil Gaiman, Salman Rushdie, Alice Hoffman, Nick Joaquin, and Nicola Barker. In Bengali literature, prominent writers of magic realism include Nabarun Bhattacharya, Akhteruzzaman Elias, Shahidul Zahir, Jibanananda Das and Syed Waliullah. In Japanese literature, one of the most important authors of this genre is Haruki Murakami. In Kannada literature, the writers Shivaram Karanth and Devanur Mahadeva have infused magical realism in their most prominent works. In Polish literature, magic realism is represented by Olga Tokarczuk, the 2018 Nobel Prize laureate in Literature.", "response": "While Latin American authors are most closely associated with magical realism, there are many others who adopt this style.
