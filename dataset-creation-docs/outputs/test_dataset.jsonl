{"instruction": "How does a transistor amplify a signal?", "response": "A transistor is a constructed from materials that behave as semiconductors--which is to say that these materials conduct electrical current but only when certain conditions are met. By combining these materials into a device called a transistor we are able to create an electronic component that will only conduct electricity when a small electric current is applied to the so-called Base pin of the transistor.\n\nOne obvious use of such behavior is to use the transistor as a switch--by applying or removing current to the base pin we are able to control whether the transistor conducts electricity via its collector and emitter pins. When no current is present at the Base pin the transistor will block electrical transmission through its emitter and collector pins.\n\nGenerally speaking, the electrical current required to control the transistor at the base pin is very small. Much larger currents can be transferred through the device through the collector and emitter pins. Thus, in effect, a transistor uses a very small input current to control the flow of a much larger current.\n\nAn audio signal, for example, is transmitted as a very low power electrical current--in it's original form it is too small to be able to drive a loudspeaker to make sounds that are audible to the human ear. To amplify this signal so that is usable for audio playback we can apply the audio signal to a transistor's base pin--this will allow a much larger current to flow between the emitter and collector pins and through the transistor. Since the flow of this large current will mirror the much smaller current of the audio signal we will have effectively created a much stronger version of the original input signal."}
{"instruction": "Which of these fruits, apple, strawberry, tomato, orange, cherry, grape; would be a poor choice to end a line in a song lyric with?", "response": "While all the items listed are indeed fruits, the worst fruit to use to end a line in a song lyric is the \"orange\" because it has no rhymes unless you're the exceptional Eminem wom can rhyme any word, including orange."}

{"instruction": "How can I help soothe a teething baby?", "response": "Babies often begin teething anywhere from 3 months onwards with most babies displaying their first tooth around 5 months of age.  Teething can be very painful and cause great discomfort for your baby.  Some things you can do to help soothe a teething baby include letting baby chew on a pacifier, teething ring (cold or room temperature), putting a wet washcloth in the freezer and letting baby suck on that, Tylenol for infants (be sure to check with your pediatrician first before giving baby any medication under 6 months of age)."}
{"instruction": "Using the provided passage, provide a bulleted list of the areas most effected by climate change.", "response": "- sub-Saharan Africa\n- South-East Asia\n- Low-lying islands and coastal communities\n- Maldives\n- Tuvalu"}
{"instruction": "Which famous musicians played a Fender Stratocaster?", "response": "There are few guitars as iconic as the Fender Stratocaster.  This guitar was originally developed in the early 1950's and has taken the world by storm.  To name a few very notable Stratocaster players the list would have to include Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Eric Clapton, John Mayer, Yngwie Malmsteen, Buddy Guy and John Frusciante.  As you can see this list spans many genres and speaks to the flexibility of this instrument."}
{"instruction": "What type of bicycle should I buy?", "response": "Buying the right bicycle depends on the experience you are interested in. For example, mountain bikes provide off-road biking experiences in forest trails and rough terrain; gravel bikes include trail and road biking experiences; road bikes provide long-distance rides on paved roads; and commuter bikes are great for casual rides."}
{"instruction": "Given this paragraph about bicycle manufacturer Colnago, what Italian automobile company did Colnago work with to develop new carbon fiber technology?", "response": "Colnago worked with Ferrari to develop new carbon fiber technology."}
{"instruction": "What is Beggar's Chicken?", "response": "In Chinese, Beggar\u2019s Chicken is called \u201c\u53eb\u5316\u9e21\u201d (Ji\u00e0o hu\u0101 j\u012b). Made with a whole chicken, the bird is marinated, seasoned, and then stuffed, after which it is wrapped in lotus leaves, then coated in clay, and finally baked.\n\nThe best part of this recipe is that when it has finished cooking, you take a hammer and crack the clay to reveal a perfectly cooked chicken inside."}
{"instruction": "Give me a simpler way to tell someone that Layli and Majnun is Persian literature that borrows storytelling techniques from Varqeh and Golshah, Orwa wa Afra, Vameq and Ozra, Metiochus and Parthenope, and Vis and Ramin.", "response": "The Persian literary story Layli and Majnun is based on several other pieces of literature, such as Varqeh and Golshah, Orwa wa Afra, Vameq and Ozra, Metiochus and Parthenope, and Vis and Ramin."}
